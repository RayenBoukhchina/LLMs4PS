Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-10-20,"Good morning, everyone.
I’m happy to be here with Deputy Prime Minister Freeland and Minister Ng, as well as Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo.
Canada has now passed a total of 200,000 cases of COVID-19 since the spring, with almost 22,000 active cases across the country today.
Here, and around the world, the fight against this virus is far from over.
And in order to win it, we have to keep working together.
Canada is a big country, and the pandemic is playing out differently in different provinces and territories.
That’s why I’m asking everyone to keep following the guidelines of their local public health authorities.
This is a Team Canada effort – and when you wear a mask, limit your in-person close contacts, and use the free COVID Alert app – you’re doing your part. 
As a government, we’re doing ours, too.
Since March, we’ve received almost 800 million pieces of personal protective equipment – masks, gloves, gowns, and face shields – to protect frontline workers and Canadians.
This month alone, we’ve distributed over 20 million pieces of PPE to the provinces and territories.
And we’re continuing to work around the clock to ship even more to the frontlines.
As we are doing all we can to ensure that Canadians stay healthy, we continue to step up our efforts to also keep our economy healthy.
This week is Small Business Week.
It’s a chance to recognize the enormous contribution that small businesses make to our country.
In recent weeks, I’ve talked to many entrepreneurs and business leaders, who offered some suggestions and also expressed their concerns.
Small businesses are the heart of our communities, the backbone of our economy, and our government is there for them.
We’re there for people like Charles-Ugo Boucher, owner of Café Larue, in my own riding of Papineau. The wage subsidy extension will help him keep his employees on the job.
During Small Business Week, I want to take a moment to recognize the hard work and perseverance that so many people put in every day, and especially over the last six months.
Whether you’ve adapted your menu to make take-out easier, or used your 3D printers to manufacture PPE, your resilience and creativity is an inspiration.
With winter coming, many business owners are hoping that clients won’t be turned off by having to line up outside in the cold.
As a government, our goal is to help you and your employees, through this tough time. 
From the beginning of this crisis, we took immediate and significant action to help Canadian businesses keep their door open and their workers on the job.
For small business owners:
The wage subsidy, the new Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program, which will go directly to small business tenants, and the Canada Emergency Business Account are there for you.
You have shown resilience and creativity, and our government will continue to take meaningful action to support you.
Recently, I spoke with many small business owners that shared their experience with me.
Dr. Hedy Fry introduced me to Lisa Arthurs, owner of Quick Nickel Clothing in Vancouver’s West End, for whom the new Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy provides direct help as she continues to work hard to keep her business running.
Of course, the extended wage subsidy and the expanded Canada Emergency Business Account are also there to help. 
Moving forward, we will continue to listen to the needs of small businesses, just like we listen to the needs of all Canadians.
We’ll be there for people, whatever it takes, as long as it takes.  
Unfortunately, our fight against COVID-19 isn’t over, and we must continue to follow the guidelines of our local public health authorities.
Wear a mask, download the free COVID Alert App, and limit your close contacts.
And as you’re making an effort to slow the spread of the virus, why not encourage small businesses in your neighbourhood and mark Small Business Week by ordering a meal from the restaurant down the street or buying a gift card for your favourite store.
I want to end this morning by taking a moment to talk about the Community Resilience Fund, which supports partnerships and innovation in countering online radicalization to violence.
The pandemic has increased the amount of time we spend in front of our screens.
And while the digital space is powerful, it’s not without issues.
Online hate is far too common, and all too often it can spill over into real life.
Better understanding violent extremism is key to preventing radicalization to violence, so that we can stop tragedies before they happen.
So far, the Community Resilience Fund has supported 39 projects across the country with a total of over $29 million.
Today, I can announce that we will invest in the YWCA Canada’s project, Block Hate: Building Resilience against Online Hate Speech.
This is an important project, and I know it will help keep our communities safe.
To all the groups and local leaders who are part of this fund: thank you for your vital work. 
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-10-16,"Hello. Good morning everyone.
I’m pleased to be here with Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo.
Minister LeBlanc is joining us virtually.
And Minister Rodriguez is also here with us to answer questions about Parliamentary happenings.    
Fighting COVID-19 is a Team Canada effort.
Right from day one, we’ve been working with all orders of government to keep people safe.
And during this second wave, that’s exactly what we’ll continue to do.
To begin with, it’s vital that frontline workers have access to personal protective equipment.
To date, the federal government has shipped almost 190 million pieces of PPE to the provinces and territories. 
At the same time, we’re providing support staff who can make over 14,000 contact tracing calls a day.
We’re also ramping up our testing at national labs across the country to help the provinces and territories with their surge capacity. 
In this second wave, just like in the first, our government stands ready to help our partners across the country keep Canadians safe.
We have been working with all levels of government, from day one, to protect you.
And that is exactly what we’re going to keep doing during the second wave.
COVID-19 isn’t just a health crisis – it’s an economic one too.
Workers and businesses across the country need support during this tough time. The fact is that the second wave has the potential to hit people really hard. So we’re going to keep stepping up to help.
Last week, I announced that we were creating the new Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy, which provides direct rent support to tenants. 
This is in addition to the extension of the wage subsidy, and the expansion of the Canada Emergency Business Account. 
These programs have been – and will continue to be – a lifeline for small business owners.
Just take Amarjeet Chandok who owns Taza Xpress in Brampton. When the pandemic first hit, Amarjeet worried about whether his business would survive.
But, by using the wage subsidy, the rent support program, and the Canada Emergency Business Account, he was able to keep his employees on the payroll and the lights on.
We’ll continue to be there for people like Amarjeet, and for small businesses right across the country that create good jobs and make our communities stronger.
We know that the second wave could hit very hard.
We are here to help. 
In our fight against COVID-19, we need all the tools we can get.
With over 4.5 million downloads, the free COVID Alert app is a powerful way to keep yourself and your loved ones safe.
The process is very simple and protects your privacy.
If you download the app, and come into contact with a person who then tests positive for COVID-19 and also has the app, it will alert you to take action. 
After receiving the alert, you can then go to a testing site or isolate yourself while waiting for your result.
This helps you to do your part to stop the transmission of this virus.
That’s why eight provinces now have the app fully up and running, and we’ll continue to work with Alberta and B.C. to get them to come on board too.  
If you haven’t already, I encourage you to go to the App Store or Google Play and download the app for free.    
We must keep taking the fight against COVID-19 seriously. This pandemic is still a very real threat.
For several weeks, you’ve been hearing me, the premiers, and public health officials urging everyone to double down on what we know works to flatten the curve and beat this second wave. 
Frankly, the numbers are still too high. And that has real consequences.  
Our frontline workers are at risk.
Our parents and grandparents in long-term care facilities are at risk.
And our loved ones who have pre-existing health conditions are at risk.
For businesses, many of which have just gotten back on the road to recovery, the second wave has pushed them to the brink once again.
This is very serious. But we have the power to turn things around.
So let’s keep doing our part for each other, and for the people that we love.
We need to keep taking this fight against COVID-19 seriously. Unfortunately, this pandemic is still a very real threat.
I understand your concern.
But we can still turn the tide.
So let’s keep doing our part to help others and to help those we love. As government, we will continue to be there for you.
This morning, I spoke with Prime Minister Pashinyan of Armenia to express our concern about the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
I told him that Canada will continue to work extremely hard with all our allies to put an end to the violence.
I encourage all sides to engage in dialogue to find peaceful resolution to the conflict. This was echoed by Minister Champagne on his trip to Europe, which is wrapping up today.
Minister Champagne’s trip included a week of meetings with our allies to discuss the global fight against COVID-19.
He also had talks about how we can find meaningful ways to support democracy in Belarus.
Today, Minister Champagne met with opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya to show our support for her, and for the people of Belarus.
We will continue to work with our international partners to ensure that the people of Belarus make sure their voices are heard.
And finally, I want to take a moment to talk to kids out there across Canada. I know that these past six months or so have been really difficult for all of you. But I know many of you had birthdays, milestones to celebrate during these past months that were really difficult and a lot less fun than usual – no families, no extended families, no parties, no friends. These are things that kids are struggling with in this time of COVID. This weekend is my dad’s birthday, but it’s also my son Xavier’s thirteenth birthday. Turning thirteen is the big moment where you get to become a teenager and all the responsibilities that come with it, but it’s also a time where friends really matter, and not having a party is tough. But, as families, as Canadians, and as kids, we need to keep doing our part and keep safe, to protect our grandparents, to make sure that we’re slowing the spread of COVID-19.
We’ve asked an awful lot of everyone across the country, especially kids. But I want you to know that we’re going to continue asking a lot of you because I know you’re capable of it. We’re there for you. Make sure you’re leaning on each other, but know that we all need to do our part to keep people safe even when it’s our special day. 
Thank you very much everyone, and I will now let Minister LeBlanc take over.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on the measures taken to support Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/10/16/prime-ministers-remarks-measures-taken-support-canadians-during-covid-19
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-10-13,"Hello everyone.
It’s good to be here this morning with Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo, as well as Minister LeBlanc, who’s joining us virtually.
I want to start this morning by addressing the unacceptable threats that were sent to a Toronto mosque over the weekend.
Islamophobia and right-wing extremism have no place in our country or our communities.
We must always stand united against hate or intolerance of any kind.
I would also like to revisit the terrible tragedy that occurred in Wendake over the weekend.
My thoughts are with the young victims’ family and friends, and with the people of the Wendake community.
We must get the bottom of what happened.
These young children had their whole lives ahead of them and we are all shocked by what happened.
We are living in unusual times.
We just had Thanksgiving weekend, and many people were unable to gather with their loved ones as they would have liked to.
But, despite the difficulties caused by this global crisis, Canadians are more united than ever. 
In the spring, we flattened the curve by all playing our part.
I know we can do the same this fall.
By continuing to download the free COVID Alert app—as 4.3 million people have already done—and by wearing masks and keeping our distance, we will once again flatten the curve and get through this pandemic.
And as you work hard to help your loved ones and your community, you can count on your government to always be there, by your side.
With rising COVID-19 cases, quick and accurate testing, deployed with the right strategy, has become more important than ever.
That’s why our government has been working around the clock with the provinces and territories to boost their testing capacity, while at the same time securing the world’s best rapid testing technology.
These efforts are paying off.
As Minister Anand announced, Canada recently secured up to 28.4 million rapid tests from Abbott.
And on that front in particular, we’re continuing to move forward.
Shortly, the federal government will be sending these new rapid tests—Abbott Panbio and Abbott ID NOW—to the provinces and territories.
Both of these new testing technologies are quick and reliable, so we’re getting them out to the frontlines as soon as possible.  
Our government is also continuing to provide surge support on processing tests, including for Ontario.
And for the First Nations communities of Kasabonika and Pikangikum, National Microbiology Lab employees are on the ground with testing kits.
It is vital that these communities—with cases of COVID-19—have the necessary testing capacity to control the spread of the virus and keep people safe.
From day one, we’ve worked with the provinces and territories to protect the most vulnerable.
Moving forward, that is what we will continue to do.
Soon, more Canadian Red Cross support will be deployed to a number of long-term care facilities.
Seniors must be safe and well cared for, and our government stands ready to help provincial counterparts in that work.
This is a point I will continue to make with the premiers at our twentieth First Ministers’ Meeting this coming Thursday.
Progress is also being made in terms of vaccines.
Toward the end of last week, Health Canada received an application for authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine candidate.
As with AstraZeneca’s application two weeks ago, this is another step toward a safe and effective vaccine for Canadians.
And while we’re on the subject, I would like to remind everyone to get a flu shot this fall.
It’s a good way to protect yourself, while helping hospitals and screening clinics to focus on fighting COVID-19 without being distracted by the flu. 
Our top priority is keeping you—and your family—healthy and safe.
That means protecting you from this virus, and also means ensuring you have the support you need to weather this storm.
Yesterday, applications opened for the new Canada Recovery Benefit.
The CRB provides $500 each week, for up to 26 weeks, for people who are self-employed or don’t qualify for employment insurance.
Since yesterday morning, over 240,000 applications have been received.
If you need this help but haven’t applied yet, go to the CRA’s My Account through Canada.ca, or call 1-800-959-2019 or 1-800-959-2041.
The application process is simple.
In fact, if you’ve used the CERB, you’ll find it very similar.
Our government will continue to do everything we can to support people through this crisis, whatever it takes, as long as it takes.
If you get COVID-19 and aren’t covered at work—the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit is there for you.
If a family member gets sick and you need to care for them—look to the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit.
If you’re affected by COVID-19—we’ve strengthened employment insurance to be there for you.
And if you can’t access EI—the Canada Recovery Benefit is able to help.
And for business owners, there’s more support, too.
This crisis has been very difficult for businesses across the country.
So we’ve strengthened major programs that we created that have been a lifeline for them. 
On Friday, we outlined the new Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy, an expanded Canada Emergency Business Account, and the extension of the wage subsidy.
The new rent subsidy will provide support to businesses directly, not through landlords.
And the CEBA includes an additional $10,000 forgivable loan for those who need it.
We’ll also work to help businesses that temporarily shut down because of local public health directions.
Canadian businesses create jobs and drive our economy, and we will continue to be there for them every step of the way.
We’re all waiting for the moment when this pandemic is over: 
For the time when we can once again have a big family dinner, go to a crowded festival, or just have life return to normal.  
Those days will be back, but only if we all keep doing our part.
The numbers are still rising.
This is the time to double down on our efforts to stop the spread.
Our loved ones, our vulnerable family members, our frontline workers—they’re counting on us to do the right thing.
So follow public health guidelines and wear a mask.
Keep your distance and join the over 4.3 million people who have already downloaded the free COVID Alert app.
Together, we will get through this.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-10-09,"Hello everyone.
I’m happy to be joined today by Deputy Prime Minister Freeland and Minister Hajdu, and by Minister Bibeau and Minister LeBlanc, virtually.
Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo are also here to present updated COVID-19 public health models.
We have lots to talk about today, so let’s get right to it.
We’re at a tipping point in this pandemic.
Not only is the second wave underway, yesterday we hit the highest daily recorded cases, well above what we saw this spring.
Increases in the number of new cases put enormous pressure on hospitals and health-care workers, who are becoming increasingly overwhelmed.
I know this is discouraging, especially going into Thanksgiving weekend.  
But remember this: when things were at their bleakest during the first wave, Canadians pulled together and flattened the curve.
Every time you wear a mask, every time you stay home when going out is unnecessary, every time you help a friend download the COVID Alert app, you are part of the solution.
We’ve flattened the curve in the spring.
We can do it again.  
And now, we have even more tools to help us.
On Tuesday, Minister Anand and Minister Hajdu announced that the government has signed an agreement with Abbott Rapid Diagnostics for up to 20.5 million rapid tests.
The COVID Alert app is up and running in 8 out of 10 provinces, now including PEI and Quebec, and has been downloaded more than 4 million times in Canada.
The more people use the app, the more powerful this tool will become.
It’s another way for each of us to do our part to protect our loved ones, our neighbours, our fellow Canadians, and our front-line workers.
I encourage you all to download the free app today.
Our top priority is keeping Canadians safe as we support people through this storm.
This morning, we received the news that 378,000 jobs were added to the economy in September, as the unemployment rate continues to go down.
This is good news for a lot of people, but we also know that there’s still lots more work to be done. 
Earlier this week, Canadians could begin accessing the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit—for people who are not covered at work if they get COVID-19 or if a family member gets sick.
Next week, applications will also open for the Canada Recovery Benefit, which is replacing the CERB for those who can’t access EI.
At the same time, we’re also looking at how else we can support businesses, as we outlined in the Throne Speech.
Although a lot of businesses have reopened, most are still not yet operating at full capacity and others are concerned about the uncertainty of a second wave.
Today we are announcing new support for Canadian businesses so that they can keep workers on the job and get through the coming months. 
Deputy Prime Minister Freeland will provide more details, but here’s the bottom line: even if many businesses have now reopened, most are not back to full capacity, while many others are facing the uncertainty of a second wave.
Our goal is to support Canadian employers and help businesses bridge to better times.
That’s why we are updating support for commercial rent with the new Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy.
This will provide support to businesses directly, not through landlords.
For businesses who have seen a revenue drop, the new rent subsidy can support up to 65 per cent of eligible expenses, and up to 90 per cent for businesses temporarily shut down by a mandatory second wave public health order.
At the same time, we are extending the wage subsidy—at a rate of up to 65 per cent of eligible wages—to December and expanding the Canada Emergency Business Account for those small businesses that need it, including with an additional $10,000 forgivable loan.  
We’ll also work to target financial support directly to businesses that have to temporarily shut down as a result of local public health directions.
We know this second wave will be even harder for those who get hit.
That’s why our response needs to be targeted and effective. 
Small and large businesses create jobs, drive our economy, and make our communities stronger.
Our government will continue to do whatever it takes to support them.
For many of us, Thanksgiving is an opportunity to share a wonderful meal with friends and family.
Although this tradition has been shaken up this year, we must not forget that there are also Canadians facing serious food insecurity.
This sad reality has been exacerbated by the pandemic.  
In April, we invested $100 million in emergency funding to help food banks and community organizations with their vital work.
Today, I can announce that we’re putting another $100 million towards supporting food banks, local food security organizations, Indigenous groups serving vulnerable people and communities, and partners for Northern communities.
This funding will be provided through the Government of Canada’s Emergency Food Security Fund, and Minister Bibeau will have more details on this in just a moment.
This morning, I went to the grocery store to buy some food to donate to the food bank, and I was reminded of a few things that those wanting to make donations should keep in mind, as I know many of you are thinking of others this Thanksgiving weekend: focus on non-perishable items, like canned goods; microwavable foods are easier for those who do not have an oven; and don’t forget to make healthy choices.
Last night I had a video call with Food Banks Canada, and got to hear from incredible volunteers and staff from right across the country.
They do remarkable work supporting vulnerable Canadians every day, and that includes this Thanksgiving weekend.
No one should be left behind, regardless of where they live.
Our government will continue to support Canadians during this crisis, especially those who are most vulnerable, who have been the hardest hit, but I encourage everyone to do their part.
In July, when we finalized the Safe Restart Agreement, the federal government and the First Ministers recognized that smaller jurisdictions face distinct challenges and circumstances.
Today, I can announce that additional top-up funds of over $37 million will be included in the first payments to the territories under this agreement.
A supplemental $41.4 million will also go towards air carriers to ensure essential air services to remote communities in the North.
Minister LeBlanc will have more details in a few minutes.
But I want to especially thank MPs Larry Bagnell and Michael McLeod, and our Minister of Northern Affairs Dan Vandal, for their leadership and their important work on supporting our Northern communities.
I know that it’s the long weekend and many of you are disappointed that you won’t be able to be together.
Thanksgiving as we know it might look a little different, but we are working—together—to do everything we can to stop the virus from spreading over the next few weeks so that we can get together again, in person, with the people we love at Christmas.
Every time you wear a mask, every time you stay at home when you don’t need to go out, every time you tell a friend to download the COVID Alert all, you are part of the solution.
Our Thanksgiving traditions may be temporarily changed by this pandemic, but our resilience and our determination remain strong.
What we do now will shape the numbers we see in two weeks and set us, hopefully, on the right track for family gatherings at Christmas.
So let’s work together, and let’s flatten the curve.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-10-08,"Hello everyone.
Thank you, Minister Bains. It’s great to be here with you, as well as Minister Anand, and Jerry Dias, the President of Unifor, at the Ford Connectivity and Innovation Centre.
As you can see, we’re joined virtually by Premier Ford in Oakville—Doug it’s always good to see you—along with our Member of Parliament for Oakville North–Burlington, Pam Damoff, and Ontario Minister Fedeli. 
We also have the Member of the Provincial Parliament for Oakville, Stephen Crawford, and the President and CEO of Ford Canada, Dean Stoneley. Thank you so much for all your leadership in this, Dean, as well.
For too many Canadians, this pandemic has meant worrying about their job or being laid off.
Everyone deserves a good job they can rely on.
That’s why two weeks ago, in the Speech from the Throne, our government outlined a plan to create and protect thousands of good, middle-class jobs and build a stronger, more resilient economy by investing in the future.
Just last week we announced a $10 billion infrastructure plan that will create tens of thousands of positions right across the country. And today, we’re taking another step forward.
The Government of Canada, in partnership with the Government of Ontario and Ford Canada, is investing $1.8 billion to transition Ford’s Oakville Assembly Plant into making zero-emission electric vehicles.  
The federal government will contribute $295 million toward this project, and the Government of Ontario will do the same.
Today’s announcement secures over 5,000 good, middle-class jobs, and is a major vote of confidence in our auto sector.
For people in Oakville, Windsor–Essex, and Ford’s entire production line, I know this is big news.
This is just one of the first steps to build a next-generation auto industry. And we have the resources to do that.  
The market for electric vehicles will grow in the future, and Canada has the talent to be a global leader in making batteries for electric vehicles, electrification, and clean technology.
That means we need to secure good jobs now, which will open up more opportunities for our auto sector to thrive into the future.   
At the same time, by investing in technology that protects the environment, we’re also taking action on our plan to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
For our auto sector, for our environment: this is a win-win.
I want to thank Premier Ford for his continued partnership, and acknowledge Jerry Dias and Minister Bains for their incredibly hard work. 
This is just another example of the important progress we can make when we all work together.
Before I end, I want to thank the Bank of Montreal for asking their employees to download the COVID Alert app. And I hope that other companies will follow BMO’s lead.
As we approach the Thanksgiving weekend, the COVID Alert app is just one of the many ways that we can keep each other safe.
We also need to keep following public health guidelines.
Wash your hands.
Wear a mask.
Keep a 2-metre distance from others.
And download the COVID Alert app, which is already making a big difference all across the country.
We’ll get through this, together.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-10-06,"Thank you, Reverend Curtis.
I knew John my whole life, in fact, John and I go back to even before I was born!
As John used to tell it, he got a last minute call from my father one Christmas Eve.
Dad told him that Mom, who was very pregnant with me, would like to go to midnight mass with John and Geills.
John was caught off guard, but he managed to call Father O’Rourke at Mount Carmel Church to make arrangements.
They made mass, went back to the Turners’ house for a nightcap, and eventually went home where my mother promptly went into labour.
I was born the next morning.
John used to impress on every young person he engaged with that we all have the ability to do great things in this world, if we make the choice to do so.
I think that’s why he was so fond of paraphrasing Saint Augustin, saying “to him or her to whom God has given talent, let him or her give some back.”
John always found a way to give back to this country, whether serving as a Member of Parliament in three different provinces, or in Cabinet.
While John was a pillar of the House of Commons, always fighting for a more just world, he remained profoundly human, he was approachable, and he always remembered your birthday. 
John shared a vision with my dad, and that vision led him to transform and modernize the Criminal Code.
John paved the way for legal aid in Canada, to ensure that everyone could defend their rights.
But what stood out to me the most was that he understood the importance of encouraging young people to get involved in our democracy, and that he devoted a great deal of his time to protecting our environment.
He often said he felt “more Canadian than ever” whenever he went off to explore our waterways and our magnificent forests.
John was a great unifier, always seeking to give back to this great country of ours.
That speaks volumes about the type of man he was.
John always noted that “democracy doesn’t happen by accident.”
He knew we could rise to any challenge, and meet any moment – if we believed in one another and stood together. 
Today, more than ever, we need more people like John.
His legacy calls on us to not wait for change to happen, but to stand up and build a better country for everyone.
John, you were a great Canadian. 
Your vision of a stronger and fairer Canada lives on.
Rest in peace.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-10-05,"Hello everyone.
I’m pleased to be here with Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo.
I want to start today with an update on COVID-19.
In the last few days, Ontario and Quebec have had their highest-ever numbers of cases.
And across the country, totals have gone up, including in long-term care homes.
That’s not where any of us wanted to be on the way into Thanksgiving.
But even if we can’t gather this long weekend, we still have a chance to turn things around for Christmas.
You’re probably already wearing a mask when you go out – now more than ever, keep it up.
The same goes for staying two metres apart, and washing your hands.
I know we keep saying it, but that’s because these small things can make a big difference.
And if you haven’t already, download the COVID Alert app now, which is another way of keeping yourself and others safe.
COVID Alert is free and protects your privacy, so download it from Google Play or the App Store.
The more people who sign up, the more powerful this tool will become.
Already in Ontario, over 600 people have registered a positive result, which automatically notified thousands of people they came into contact with.
Now is the time for all of us to use the app.
Our government's number one priority is people's safety.
We have now procured more than two billion pieces of personal protection equipment for Canadians.
Over the past month, our government has delivered tens of millions of items to the provinces and territories – from face shields to masks, gowns, and gloves.
In terms of screening equipment such as swabs, not only have we supplied the provinces and territories, but we now have two Canadian companies that are authorized to supply swabs made right here in Canada with 3D printers.
And last week, Health Canada received its first request for authorization for the AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, to which we have secured access.
This is another step towards ensuring that Canadians get a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible
Our government will continue doing everything we can to support people through this crisis, whatever it takes, as long as it takes.
Yesterday, I had a very productive call with Mayor Tory of Toronto, about addressing the challenges facing Canada’s largest city.
Later today, I’ll be speaking with Mayor Watson from Ottawa, and Mayor Brown from Brampton.
I will soon be speaking with Mayor Plante from Montréal, and I just spoke with Mayor Labeaume from Quebec City.  
Beating this virus is a Team Canada effort, and we’re here for Canadians right across the country.
We’ve created the COVID Testing Assistance Response Team, to quickly deploy across Canada because the federal government stands ready to help.
Federal lab space is also providing surge support on processing of tests, including for Ontario for 1,000 tests a day.
And additional federal labs will be added.
On contact tracing, we have agreements in place with Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta, with more to come for other provinces and territories. 
There are 500 full-time contact tracers provided for Ontario, including 30 tracers specifically for Ottawa.
At the same time, we’re moving forward with programs that go directly to Canadians.
As of this morning, applications for the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit are open.
These two programs are for Canadians not covered at work if they get COVID-19, or if their kids or parents get it and they have to take care of them.
If you need this support, go to the CRA’s My Account through Canada.ca, or call 1-800-959-2019 or 1-800-959-2041.
Next week, applications will also open for the Canada Recovery Benefit, to support people who are directly affected by COVID-19 but can’t access EI.
These three new programs – the Recovery Benefit, the Sickness Benefit, and the Caregiving Benefit – are there for you.
This fall is turning out to be pretty challenging for a lot of Canadians, including for young people.
For students:
I know this isn’t the Thanksgiving – let alone the year – you had hoped for.
But even if things are different this long weekend, I hope you still take some time – probably online – with loved ones.  If you’re feeling overwhelmed or you’re struggling, reach out.
You have a whole network – family, friends, teachers – that’s there for you.
I know we’re going through really tough times right now – everyone is – but we need you, your strength, your resilience, your vision for the future. We will continue to be there for you. You got this.
And on that note, I’d like to mention that it is World Teachers’ Day.
As a dad, and someone who’s spent time at the front of a classroom, I know how important teaching can be.
So to teachers and educators across the country: thank you for everything you do.
Of course, even in regular times the job is not without its challenges.
And right now, teachers are facing circumstances that none of us could have ever predicted.
But despite everything, you are doing an incredible job.
You are devoted every day and you are making a huge difference in the lives of our young people.
Later today, we will be announcing the names of 71 exception educators from around the country who will be given the Prime Minister’s Award for Teaching Excellence.
These are people who believe in our children and, as a result, are helping build a better future for us all.
Not only are you navigating health rules and online learning, you’re guiding young people through an incredibly difficult and challenging new world.
You’re there for our kids, and know that our government will be there for you.
We created the $2 billion Safe Return to Class Fund, to keep you and your students safe.
For Edmonton Public Schools, this money has helped with rapid testing to protect staff and students.
For schools in London, Ontario, it has meant buying more PPE and hiring additional teachers.
And right across the country, this investment is going towards keeping all of our classrooms healthy.
As with the Safe Return to Class Fund, we will continue to find other ways to ensure the safety of all Canadians.
Flattening the curve – whether in schools or workplaces – is our top priority in the coming weeks.
And finally, I want to let Canadians know that I’ve asked the Foreign Minister to travel to Europe, to discuss with our allies the developments in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, particularly in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Thank you very much.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-10-02,"Hello everyone.
I’m pleased to be here with Minister Joly, Minister LeBlanc, Dr. Tam, and Dr. Njoo.
Before I get started, I’d like to address the recent news coming from the United States where the President and First Lady have tested positive for COVID-19.
Sophie and I both wish President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump a safe and speedy recovery.
Earlier this year, Canadians worked hard to slow the spread of COVID‑19. Our fight against the virus isn’t over, and we must all continue to do our part to save lives.    
While the number of cases is increasing across the country, it is important to follow all public health advice.
That means wearing a mask, staying two metres away from others, washing your hands, and downloading the free COVID Alert app.
We continue to encourage all provinces and territories to launch this extremely useful tool. The app is now active in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, which join the other five provinces that have already signed on. The Government of Quebec will also be making an announcement about this very soon.
As a Quebec MP, I cannot emphasize strongly enough how important it is to make use of all the tools available to us to protect the population.
I want to reassure you by repeating that your privacy is fully protected with this app. 
It does not collect data on your location. In addition, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada supports its use.
And even if your region has not yet officially signed on, don’t wait, because the app starts working to protect you from the moment it is downloaded.
So I encourage all Canadians to download the free COVID Alert app from the App Store or Google Play Store as a way to help keep you and others safe.  
Tackling COVID-19 has been a Team Canada effort and, last night, I had my 19th First Ministers’ meeting with the premiers since the start of this pandemic.
Minister LeBlanc will talk more about how all orders of government are continuing to work together to keep Canadians safe.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, our government has been focusing on supporting Canadian workers, and the small businesses that create good, middle-class jobs. 
We created the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, which kept employees on the payroll. And we also introduced the Canada Emergency Business Account that helps employers pay for things like hand sanitizers and face shields.
To support even more businesses, we invested almost $1 billion to create the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund.
This funding flowed through the Regional Development Agencies, with a portion also going to the Community Futures Network of Canada, to help businesses in rural and remote areas.
These organizations know the specific needs of their regions and the businesses they serve. And we’ve heard from small businesses about how important that funding was to keep the lights on.
We need to continue to support workers and small businesses as we move through this second wave.  
So on that front, I have some important news to share.
Today I can announce that our government is investing another $600 million for the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund.
This funding will support the Community Futures Network of Canada and five Regional Development Agencies—the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions, FedDev Ontario, FedNor, and Western Economic Diversification Canada.
Minister Joly will have more to say, but here’s the bottom line: we will be here for Canadians, whatever it takes, for as long as it takes.
In the last six months, most Canadians have been able to stay at home if they need to, because they have a safe place to live.  
But that isn’t the reality for everyone.
Women and children who are the victims of violence often don’t feel like they have anywhere else to go.
And that’s unacceptable. 
Earlier this year, we invested $50 million to support over 1,000 women’s organizations and shelters across the country. And this funding helped them do things like hire more staff to manage work, and improve cleaning and safety plans.
No one should have to choose between facing violence at home or dealing with a pandemic in the streets.
We know that women’s safety must be the foundation on which all progress is built, and today, we’re taking another step to address gender-based violence.
The Government of Canada is investing an additional $50 million to support organizations that provide services for women and children who face violence.  
The funding will include $10 million for women’s shelters and sexual assault centres across the country, and another $10 million for gender-based violence services that support Indigenous women and children living off-reserve.
The remaining $30 million will go to women’s organizations that combat gender-based violence, including those that deliver vital services like counselling support and crisis intervention.
I’d like, as always, to thank Minister Monsef for her tremendous work on this important issue. 
Our government will continue to be there for those who face gender-based violence, and we will continue to work with the organizations that support them.   
I’d like to end today by recognizing that October is the start of Women’s History Month.
Our country would not be what it is without the tireless and selfless contributions of women throughout our history.  
Every day, women across the country dedicate their lives to making Canada a better place for everyone.
As we celebrate these women, I encourage us all to remember our own role in being active allies.
And let’s work together to advance gender equality through our everyday actions.
Thank you, everyone.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-10-01,"Good morning, everyone.
I am pleased to be here with the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, Catherine McKenna, and the Chair of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, Michael Sabia. 
Before making today’s announcement, I would like to take a moment for a COVID-19 update.
In the last few days, COVID-19 cases have continued to rise across the country.  
Ontario has seen its highest ever daily number of cases.
Montréal and Quebec City are at their top level of alert.
And everywhere, this virus remains a threat.
Last spring, we worked together to flatten the curve. I know we can do that again this fall.
So please, keep following public health instructions: Wear a mask, wash your hands, and keep your distance.
And, if you haven’t already, download the COVID Alert app from the App Store or Google Play.
It’s free, it protects your privacy, and it’s another way to keep yourself and others safe.
As of this morning, Manitoba has now brought the app fully online, joining Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan.
And in the coming days, we’re looking forward to even more provinces following their lead. So, download the app today.
For our part, the government is continuing to work with the provinces and territories to keep you safe.
Earlier this week, I called Premier Ford and Premier Legault to offer my full support, as we face this second wave together.
We talked about what more our government could do, especially in terms of screening, and support for small and medium-sized businesses.
Later today, we will hold our nineteenth meeting with Canada’s premiers.
I am thinking of the Safe Restart Agreement and the Safe Return to Class Fund.
These are federal investments that help with all kinds of measures, including personal protective equipment, and the protection of children and school staff.
The priority, right now, is to help Canadians weather the storm.
Last Wednesday, in the Speech from the Throne, we announced our plan to support Canadians through this crisis, as long as it takes, whatever it takes.
Job one remains keeping people safe.
And as we do that, we’re also going to fight for the livelihoods of every single worker.
This spring was tough for a lot of people who either lost their jobs, or saw their hours cut.
And while many Canadians are back at work, many others are still looking.
As a government, there are ways we can help by building on what we’ve done so far.
In the Throne Speech, we announced a plan to create over a million jobs for Canadians.
We’ll make this happen by extending the wage subsidy and investing in youth employment.
And we’ll also look at opportunities in growing sectors, which is what I want to talk about today.
This morning, our government is launching a $10-billion infrastructure plan to build stronger, healthier communities while helping Canadians get back to work.
In fact, this plan alone will create about 60,000 jobs right across the country.
Through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, this three-year Growth Plan will invest in everything from clean power, zero-emission buses and home retrofits, to broadband and irrigation infrastructure for farmers.
This is a win-win.
With smart, targeted investments, we can get people back on the job and grow the economy, while building a healthy, sustainable future for everyone.
As we work to build a stronger country, we must ensure that no one is left behind.
The past six months have been difficult for everyone, but especially for many of our seniors.
Seniors: you worked hard your entire lives and now it’s our turn to work hard to give you the best support possible.
Our government will continue to listen, and we will stay on the lookout, to ensure you have everything you need.
As we announced in the Speech from the Throne, we will continue to take steps to protect people in long-term care facilities, while helping seniors to stay in their homes longer and increasing benefits.
Our communities—just like our families—are stronger because of the contributions of seniors.
On National Seniors Day, and every day, let’s recognize the people in our lives who helped raise us, and who made this country what it is.
Finally, I want to end today by recognizing some important news out of the House of Commons.
Earlier this morning, our government introduced a Bill to end conversion therapy in Canada.
It’s past time to put a stop to this unacceptable, discredited practice that has hurt far too many LGBTQ2 Canadians.
Conversion therapy is harmful, degrading, and has no place in Canada.
I hope all parties step up, come together, and support this Bill.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-09-25,"Hello everyone.
I’m happy to be here today with Minister Anand, Dr. Tam, and Dr. Njoo.
Right from the start of the pandemic, our government’s top priority has been to keep Canadians safe from COVID-19.
As we laid out in the Throne Speech on Wednesday, protecting people will continue to be job one as we move forward.
And one of the best ways to do that is with a safe and effective vaccine. 
Our government has already invested in a strategy for increased screening, and support for vaccine research and clinical trials.
We’ve been guided by science since the very beginning.
And right now, both the COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force and the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force are doing important work to help us identify the most promising vaccine options and strategies.
Last month, I announced that the Government of Canada had signed agreements with Novavax, and Johnson &amp; Johnson to secure millions of doses of the vaccines they are developing.
We have also secured agreements with Pfizer and Moderna.
And earlier this week, Minister Anand announced that the Government of Canada has now also signed agreements with Sanofi and with GlaxoSmithKline to secure up to 72 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine candidate.
The solutions to eradicate this pandemic can be found in screening, scientific research, and vaccines.
Canadians must have access to a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 as quickly as possible, no matter where it was developed.
Today, we are taking another step in the right direction.   
I can announce that we’ve reached an agreement with AstraZeneca for the vaccine they are developing with the University of Oxford.
This agreement secures up to 20 million doses for Canadians, should the vaccine be approved following successful trials.
I know Minister Anand will have more to say about this in a few minutes, but before she does, I also want to talk about another measure we’re taking on vaccines.
This pandemic can’t be solved by any one country alone.
Because to eliminate the virus anywhere, we need to eliminate it everywhere.
That’s why Canada is helping ensure vaccines are distributed quickly and fairly around the world by supporting GAVI’s COVAX Facility and Advance Market Commitment.
Our government will invest an additional $440 million for the COVAX facility to provide doses around the world, for Canadians and for people in developing countries.
Up to $220 million of this investment will go directly towards securing doses for Canadians.
This means this agreement will give us the option to purchase up to 15 million doses for Canadians.
As of today, we now have active cases in every single province, with a significant increase in our four largest provinces.
So please, everyone, keep following public health recommendations.
Wash your hands, keep your distance, wear a mask, and download the COVID Alert app.
What we do now will be critical for the weeks and months to come.    
The fight against COVID-19 is not over yet, and we must all continue to do our part.
Our government is right there with you, as we work to keep people safe, while building a stronger, more resilient Canada.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-07-16,"Hello everyone.
From the outset, our government has worked closely with the provinces and territories to support Canadians during the pandemic.
Fighting COVID-19 has always been a Team Canada effort and it continues to be as we move into the recovery phase.
We’ve been working with our provincial and territorial partners to outline what needs to be done over the next six to eight months to safely restart our economy.
And today, I have some good news to share.
Our government will invest over $19 billion to ensure the provinces and territories have the support they need to protect the health of Canadians, help people get back to work safely, and prepare for a potential second wave. 
As part of this agreement, we’ve outlined seven priority areas on which to focus our efforts, like increased testing and contact tracing, securing more personal protective equipment, and more support for the most vulnerable, including for seniors in long-term care facilities and nursing homes.
But COVID-19 isn’t just a health crisis. It’s an economic crisis, too.
So when we talk about the recovery phase, it’s not just about making sure we can detect, control, and prevent future outbreaks.
It’s also about helping people, businesses, and entire communities adjust to our new normal, because until we find a vaccine, the daily threat of COVID-19 will not disappear.
In addition to buying more PPE so workers can follow public health guidelines at the office, we also have to make sure that people can get to work safely, that children are looked after, and that those who can’t find work right away are supported.
So, making sure there are enough safe childcare spaces available or supporting people who don’t have paid sick leave – those must be top priorities, too.
This agreement also includes more support for municipalities.
Our towns and cities have been at the forefront of responding to COVID-19 since the beginning.
Cities must remain up and running if our economy is to eventually get back up and running.
If cities aren’t equipped for a safe restart, people will not be safe.
That’s why today’s agreement provides municipalities with funding to cover operational costs.
We’re also going to give more support for transit specifically.
If we want people to participate in the economy, they need to be able to get to work safely.
No one should have to turn down a job because they don’t want to risk their health during a crowded commute.
Investments in municipalities and in transit will be shared evenly between the federal and provincial governments.
As we prepare our economic recovery, all orders of government know we have to keep working together to keep people safe.
Canadians can count on us.
On that note, I want to thank Deputy Prime Minister Freeland, the Premiers, and officials who have worked hard to support Canadians and lay the groundwork for our economic recovery with this agreement.
I want to close this press conference with some news regarding the Canada-U.S. border.
Once again, Canada and the United States have agreed to extend the current border measures by one month, until August 21.
And we’re going to keep working closely with our American neighbours to keep people safe on both sides of the border.
Tomorrow, Minister Morneau will announce more details about the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. We will also have more to say about how we plan to provide more support for people with disabilities.
We have already shared the bill with the opposition parties, so we will have more news on that.
Once again, thank you for joining us.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on the Safe Restart Agreement,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/07/16/prime-ministers-remarks-safe-restart-agreement
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-07-16,"Today is a great day for Canada and I am really, really happy to be here to talk with you about it.
From the start, a Team Canada response to the COVID-19 pandemic has not only been desirable. It has been absolutely essential.
Our shared public health goal has been to save the lives of Canadians, to protect the health of Canadians, and to prevent our health care system from being overwhelmed.
Our shared economic goal has been to ensure that no Canadian goes hungry or is made homeless because of the economic slowdown inevitably caused by the health care measures we have taken in response to this global pandemic.
To those first two priorities, today we add a third: the safe restart of our country’s economy so that families in every part of Canada can get back on their feet, in a way that is safe and sustainable for the long term.
And that is why I am so thrilled that we are able to talk to you today about the Safe Restart Agreement that federal government has reached with the provinces and territories.
This is what today’s agreement with the provinces and territories will do:
We know the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly disrupted our society and our economy and it will continue to do so in ways we cannot yet predict. We know one thing though. We can only meet this huge challenge effectively if we work together as Team Canada. If we set aside our partisan divisions and we all come together to get our country through this. And that is what we have done with the Safe Restart Agreement that we concluded today. I’d like to thank all of the premiers of the provinces and territories and mayors across our country for getting this across the finish line.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-07-08,"Hello everyone.
This week is off to a productive start.
Yesterday, Minister Miller signed a new, co-developed protocol with National Chief Bellegarde to move forward on much-needed reforms of Indigenous child and family services.
It should be up to Indigenous peoples to decide what is best for their children, families, and communities, and with this protocol, we’re taking another important step in the right direction.
We also announced new investments to expand access to cultural, emotional, and mental health support services for those affected by the national tragedy of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, as well as the Federal Indian Day Schools Settlement Agreement.
To continue walking the road of reconciliation, we must work with survivors, families, and communities on the support they need.
There’s still much to be done, but yesterday’s announcements are another important step along our shared path.
Earlier this week, we held a two-day virtual Cabinet retreat.
It was an opportunity for our team to get together after an eventful start to the year and to establish our priorities for the weeks and months ahead.
We talked about how the virus is progressing across the country as well as our response so far. We also talked about its consequences on the economy, and what our government can and must do to fight systemic racism.
I will start with our discussions on the pandemic.
On Monday, we spoke with Dr. Tam, the Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Nemer, the Chief Science Advisor, and Dr. Naylor, who heads the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force.
From the start, our response has been based on science and data, and that’s what we will continue doing as we restart certain activities.
It’s the only way to protect Canadians and to put a stop to COVID-19 for good.
Later today, we’ll be releasing a public health modelling update on COVID-19 in Canada.
We’ll have more details then, but for now, I want to give a quick overview.
Last week, we said that nationally, the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is declining over time.
That is still the case today.
The situation is stabilizing in Canada because Canadians did their part and followed public health instructions.
But, we still have to be very careful. Things can change quickly.
As Dr. Tam will explain later, we still have some hot spots in some parts of the country, including in long-term care facilities and agricultural work settings.
So, as we continue to gradually reopen the economy, we have to remain vigilant. We have to keep following public health advice.
COVID-19 caused not only a health crisis, but also an economic crisis.
This was one of the main subjects we discussed during our Cabinet retreat.
A lot of people were unable to work for weeks and others lost their jobs.
And while all sectors of the economy have suffered the consequences of this pandemic, some have been hit harder than others.
To better understand the impacts of COVID-19 on our economy, we will be releasing a fiscal and economic snapshot this afternoon.
Minister Morneau will have more to say on this later today, but for now, I want to talk about the main takeaways.
When the pandemic first hit, a lot of people lost their jobs overnight. They didn’t know how they were going to feed their families or pay their bills.
Faced with this unprecedented challenge, our government had two options.
We could sit back, let Canadians fend for themselves, and hope that it would all be over soon – or we could swiftly and substantially choose to support Canadians.
We chose to support Canadians.
As we measure the cost of helping Canadians, we shouldn’t forget that the cost of doing nothing would have been far more to both our health and our economy.
This is not, and has not been, a time for tightening of belts or for austerity.
By building a bridge for Canadians through this crisis, we can and will build a stronger, more resilient Canada.
Today, Canada has one of the most ambitious and comprehensive plans to counter the economic impacts of this pandemic.
We increased financial support to vulnerable groups like seniors and students.
We provided loans to businesses struggling with cash flow, helped employers rehire their employees, and supported those who had lost their jobs.
In fact, nearly 11 million Canadians have been supported through the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy or the CERB.
Our government took on debt to reduce the amount that Canadians themselves had to take on.
We were able to do this because Canada entered this crisis on a strong footing, with a net debt-to-GDP ratio considerably lower than the rest of the G7.
Our government was well positioned to be there for Canadians and lay the groundwork for our economy to bounce back.
Four months later, we’ve slowed down the progression of the virus significantly and we’re now seeing parts of the economy reopen.
And, historically low interest rates mean manageable borrowing costs as we continue to invest in Canadians and in the economy. 
Now, the road to recovery will not be an easy one.
Some sectors will bounce back more quickly than others. Some people will be able to find work, but others won’t right away.
As we move into this recovery phase, Canadians can count on us to always be in their corner.
Over the past two days, our team also talked about what concrete steps this government must take to fight racism and build a more inclusive Canada.
Because here are the facts: prejudice, discrimination, and violence are a lived reality for far too many Canadians.
And it’s the result of systems which all too often condone, normalize, perpetrate, and perpetuate inequality and injustice against racialized people.
Our government pledged to work with racialized communities and Indigenous peoples to address systemic racism.
Over the last five years, we’ve invested in mental health resources for Black youth and worked to close the gaps in services for Indigenous communities.
And we now have Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy, which has begun its work to change the way we do things and break down barriers.
We’ve made progress, but it’s nowhere near enough.
So, Cabinet has put together a work plan for the summer months.
Our goal is to come up with strong policies that will help eliminate barriers facing Indigenous peoples, racialized people, and persons with disabilities.
Minister Lametti is working on justice reforms.
Minister Blair is focused on modernizing policing structures and updating standards regarding the use of force.
Ministers Bains and Ng are looking at improving access to capital and generating more capacity.
Ministers Mendicino and Qualtrough are exploring ways to ensure better protection for temporary foreign workers.
And Ministers Blair and Miller are committed to co-developing a legislative framework, which recognizes First Nations policing as an essential service, and expand the number of communities served by First Nations policing.
We have our work cut out for us, but we’re ready.
Fighting systemic racism, unconscious bias, and discrimination is a top priority for our government and we will continue to listen and work with communities, and allies to build a better Canada.
I want to end today by congratulating Bob Rae on his appointment as Canada’s Ambassador to the United Nations.
Ambassador Rae has dedicated his life to serving Canada, most recently as Canada’s Special Envoy on Humanitarian and Refugee Issues and before that, as Canada’s Special Envoy to Myanmar.
In these roles, he worked closely with the UN and the international community to help lead Canada’s humanitarian efforts.
I know he will build on the work of Ambassador Marc-André Blanchard and defend our interests and our values with integrity.
I would also like to thank Ambassador Blanchard for his many years of outstanding service.
Marc-André strengthened our relationships and built bridges with new partners throughout his mandate.
I wish him all the best for the future.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-07-03,"Hello everyone.
Before I get started, I want to address the troubling news coming out of Hong Kong.
Canada joins the international community in expressing its grave concern with the passage of national security legislation for Hong Kong by mainland China.
After studying the legislation and its impact, Canada will treat exports of sensitive goods to Hong Kong in the same way as those destined for mainland China.
Effective immediately, Canada will not permit the export of sensitive military items to Hong Kong.
We are also suspending the Canada-Hong Kong extradition treaty, and updating our travel advisory for Hong Kong.
Canada is a firm believer in the ‘one country, two systems’ framework.
We will continue to support the many connections between Canada and Hong Kong, while also standing up for its people.  
In the days and weeks to come, we’re also looking at additional measures, including around immigration.
I’m very pleased today to join Steve MacKinnon, Member of Parliament for Gatineau, at Moisson Outaouais.
I just met some exceptional volunteers who work here at the food bank. Thank you all for the work you do.
I also spoke with Diane and Armand, the President and Executive Director of Moisson Outaouais. They told me about the difficulties they’ve been dealing with during the crisis.
The pandemic has led more people to seek assistance from the food bank.
Like many organizations across the country, Moisson Outaouais needed some help to deal with this new reality.
So our government invested 100 million dollars to support food banks like Moisson Outaouais, to help them continue their essential work.
With this funding, Moisson Outaouais was able to hire more delivery drivers and purchase more food.
Over the last four months, Canadians have come together to help each other and keep each other safe.
It’s taken a lot of hard work and many sacrifices, but it’s starting to pay off.
We are controlling the spread of this virus. 
And because the situation continues to improve, we can now pick up where we left off on many of the things we had to put on hold over the spring.   
As a first step, we’re moving forward on 92 infrastructure projects in British Columbia under the Investing in Canada Plan.
All told, these investments amount to $150 million, and will create good, well-paying jobs right across B.C.
I’d like to thank Premier Horgan for his support and partnership throughout this process.
It just goes to show that by working together, we can continue to create jobs.  
As we work to reopen the economy, our government’s priority is to help build stronger, more prosperous communities.
This work includes helping people return to their jobs.
Many businesses across the country are using the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to rehire their employees.
In total, the program has helped retain 2.8 million employees.
And with other initiatives like the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program and the Canada Emergency Business Account, we are supporting businesses that are vital to our economy. 
But we know there’s still much work to be done.
This morning, I can announce that our government is taking yet another step to help Canadians get the training and support they need to find good, well-paying jobs.
As part of our annual funding, we’re investing $40 million over three years in the Union Training and Innovation Program.
Skilled tradespeople are a vital part of our workforce.
They build our towns, our cities, our communities, and they will play an important role as we restart the economy. 
This pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge for our country.
And as I’ve said right from the start, our response to COVID-19 will evolve as the situation changes.
Next week, I’ll be hosting a two-day virtual Cabinet retreat.
This will be an opportunity to map out our approach going forward to keep Canadians healthy and safe, and keep our economy strong.
We will also discuss how we can make our country more resilient to potential future waves of the virus.
Of course, COVID-19 is not the only challenge that Canada faces.
So this retreat will be a chance to move forward on addressing systemic discrimination and systemic racism.  
Next week, our government will also be releasing an economic and fiscal snapshot.
This report, which Minister Morneau will present to Parliament on Wednesday, will give Canadians a picture of where the economy is right now, how our response compares to that of other countries, and what we can expect in the months to come.  
Speaking of next week, let me also remind people who receive Old Age Security benefits and the Guaranteed Income Supplement, that you will see an increase in your benefits this coming week.
In May, we announced this one-time boost of $300 for OAS, and $200 to the GIS.
Together, this means that if you get both benefits, you’ll receive an additional $500. 
This is only one example of the ways we are supporting seniors when they need it the most.
Before concluding, I want to take a moment to recognize that Monday will be the seventh anniversary of the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster.
It will be a difficult day for many.
Over the last few years, the community of Lac-Mégantic has demonstrated incredible strength and resilience.
As we remember all those we lost, our thoughts are with the families who have been affected by this tragedy.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-07-01,"Happy Canada Day!
Usually, as a country, our main concerns today would be to start the barbecue at the right time and to decide whether to let our children stay up to watch the fireworks.
Many of you are still probably thinking about those things but, this year, they are far from the only challenges you are thinking about.
This year is unlike any other. But it’s certainly not the first time that our country has celebrated today during tough times.
80 years ago, our parents and grandparents marked this day almost a year into the Second World War.
Well, eight decades later, that sounds pretty familiar.
Maybe you’re able to spend today with family and friends – something I don’t think anyone will take for granted after this spring.
But maybe that’s not possible for you. Maybe you’re celebrating without someone you love.
A mum who’s a frontline worker. A friend who hasn’t been able to come home. A loved one you’ve lost to this terrible virus.
The last few months have been hard, and on this Canada Day, we need to continue to be there for each other.
As Canadians, we understand how important it is to be there for each other.
We have lived through too many long winters not to help a stranger dig their car out of a snowbank.
Because as Canadians, when times are tough, we don’t turn our backs on people. We help each other.
We are there for the most vulnerable, and those who are suffering. We think about the people we love and even those we don’t know.
The reason that our communities are resilient – and I know that they are – the reason that Canada stands strong and united – and I know that it does – is the choices that Canadians make every single day.
The nurses and doctors who protect those around them. The women and men in uniform who serve at home and overseas. And the people, of every age, faith, and creed, who stand by one another.   
In recent months, we have joined forces from coast to coast to get through some tough times.
And we now have the opportunity to build a better Canada for everyone.
This is our challenge for 2020 and the years to come.
And I know that we can do it.
What makes Canada special is not that we know that this is the best country in the world – it’s that we know it could be. We know our work together is not yet done.
Not until every senior has a safe place to live.
Not while anyone faces racism or injustice.
Not while we still have so far to go on the path of reconciliation.
Where we go from here is up to each of us.
“It has become Canada’s century. Canada’s century of opportunity to change the course of history.”
That was the reality our parents and grandparents were called to face. That was the challenge to which they rose. And this is the country they built.
On this Canada Day, it is our turn. We must now restart and rebuild a Canada for the 21st century. My friends, I know that together, we are ready.
Happy Canada Day, everyone!

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-29,"Hello everyone.
Since the beginning of the crisis, our government has been focused on keeping Canadians safe and making sure people are supported during this challenging time.
And as we move into the summer, this work continues.
While we’ve made good progress over the past few months, the virus remains a very serious threat to our health.
And with parts of the economy shut down for many months, a lot of people need help getting back on their feet. So, we’re going to continue helping in every way we can.
Our government has launched new programs and made new investments to help businesses reopen safely, get people back on the job, and lay the groundwork for our economy to come roaring back.
If you own a business and you’re struggling with cash flow, you can get a loan through the Canada Emergency Business Account to bridge to better times.
If you’re a student or a recent grad looking for a job, we’ve created thousands of new work placements through Canada Summer Jobs and the Student Work Placement Program.
And if you’re an employer and you need help to bring back your staff, the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy is there for you through this summer.
In every part of the country, business owners are stepping up and hiring back their staff, from Brooks Signs in Brantford, Ontario to Anchor D Guiding &amp; Outfitting in Turner Valley, Alberta.
And moving forward, our government will help even more businesses bring back their workers.
Over the past few weeks, life has slowly started returning to normal, and that’s good news for all of us.
But with it also comes new challenges.
Our government continues to follow the situation closely and listen to Canadians.
People want programs that respond to their needs and realities.
The federal government intends to extend the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance by another month and we’re working with the provinces and territories to do just that. 
This program is helping thousands of small businesses across the country save on rent.
We know that many business owners are struggling with cash flow right now, so we’re working on a solution.
With summer officially here, I know a lot of people are wondering what to expect for the coming months.
So, this afternoon, Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo will release the latest public health modelling.
We’ll have more details then, but here’s the main takeaway from these projections.
After a very challenging spring, things are continuing to move in the right direction.
We still have some hot spots in some parts of the country, but nationally, the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is declining over time.
And that’s because Canadians are doing their part.
You took this seriously. You followed public health instructions, and made sacrifices, so we could get this virus under control.
Over the coming weeks, we’re going to keep regularly updating Canadians on how this virus is progressing, as we have since the beginning of this crisis, including with the latest numbers continuing to be published every single day.
As we move into this new phase however, Dr. Tam, Dr. Njoo, and I will provide an update on the pandemic a few times a week, instead of every day, when we have briefings or information to share.
I want to stress though, that while we’re on the right track, the fight against COVID-19 is not over yet.
As we start to reopen parts of the economy, we must continue to follow local public health guidelines to keep each other safe.
With Canada Day right around the corner, we have another busy week ahead of us.
In addition to our ongoing response to COVID-19, the new NAFTA will come into force on Wednesday.
With trade between NAFTA members valued at nearly $1.5 trillion in 2018, we can’t overstate how vital it is to maintain free and fair trade between our three countries.
Millions of jobs depend on a strong and stable relationship with our partners.
This deal secures access to the North American market for our business owners, entrepreneurs, and consumers.
It removes uncertainty for our manufacturers, our investors, and our workers.
This deal is good for Canada and good for Canadians.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on ongoing COVID-19 updates,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/06/29/prime-ministers-remarks-ongoing-covid-19-updates
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-26,"Hello everyone.
Today I’m at Big Rig Brewery with brew master Lon Ladell, and the MP for Kanata-Carleton, Karen McCrimmon.
Last time I was here at Big Rig was with President Obama, so I’m glad to be back.
Now, when the pandemic first started, Big Rig took a real hit.
They had to close their doors and let go almost all of their staff.
Eventually, Lon was able to start hiring back some of his team, and they wasted no time in adapting to the new normal.
They set up an online shop and, with the help of Shopify, started making home deliveries.
But Lon and his team wanted to do more for their community and for our frontline workers.
So, they started making hand sanitizer for local community organizations that do really important work, like the Kanata food bank, Shepherds of Good Hope, and Chrysalis House.
To keep up with a growing demand for hand sanitizer, food, and beer, Big Rig used the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to hire back almost all their members of staff.
And to save money on rent, they also used the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance.
Big Rig is one of the thousands of companies across the country stepping up to help their workers and their community during this tough time.
Programs like the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance are there to help them get back on their feet.
We also launched the Canada Emergency Business Account to help small businesses get a loan to bridge to better times.
And we recently expanded the eligibility for this program to include even more small businesses, like farmers. As of today, this expanded CEBA will be available through the major banks.
We’re actively working with other lenders, including credit unions, to make sure small businesses have access to the help they need.
As we move into the summer, Canadians can keep counting on our support.
All levels of government are working together to ensure that Canadians can return to work safely.
Last night, the premiers, the Deputy Prime Minister, and I held our fifteenth weekly call.
We notably discussed our government’s proposal to provide $14 billion to meet the most urgent needs in the coming months.
This money could be used to ensure children’s safety at daycare, to accelerate contact tracing research, or to buy more personal protective equipment.
As we begin reopening the economy, we must ensure that Canadians have everything they need to protect their health and their family’s health.
The premiers and I also talked about the border restrictions and the need for caution as we head into summer.
COVID-19 is still a health threat.
That’s why our government will continue working closely with the provinces and territories to support people through this difficult time.
I would now like to give you an update on the Canadian Armed Forces presence in Quebec and Ontario.
This morning, I want to take a moment to thank our Canadian Armed Forces for stepping up once again in our time of need.
Since April, our women and men in uniform have done great work to help stabilize the situation in long-term care facilities.
As of today, our members remain active in one facility in Ontario, and we anticipate that they’ll be ready to leave in the coming days, once the situation is stable.
In Quebec, the members of our Canadian Armed Forces have done a remarkable job since they started their mission on April 20.
Our troops have helped to stabilize things in a total of 47 residences.
But their mission isn’t over.
They will be stabilizing another four residences in the coming days.
Overall, the situation in long-term care facilities has improved greatly. The needs are not the same as they were two months ago.
That is why, over the past few weeks, we have worked with Quebec to develop a transition plan that will allow us to transfer ongoing operations from military personnel to civilian personnel.
And today, we can announce that the Canadian Red Cross will lend a hand until September 15.
A few weeks ago, our government provided the Red Cross with $100 million, which will allow it to provide 900 people who are ready to serve in long-term care facilities.
The first group of 150 people will be deployed by July 6 and 750 more people will start work by July 29.
The arrival of the Red Cross will allow our armed forces members to return to their regular duties and to be prepared for any eventuality.
We will still be maintaining teams that are ready to quickly intervene in case of emergency until September 15.
Canadians can always count on our support.
I’d like to end today by recognizing that this is a weekend when many of us would be heading to a Pride celebration.
Pride is a chance to celebrate who we are, and take stock not only of how far we’ve come as a society, but how far we still have to go.
Because there’s still so much more work to be done to ensure greater rights, protections, and inclusion for all LGBTQ2 people.
I know that many of you are disappointed that you can’t get together this year, but I hope that you still all get to celebrate in your own way.
And to the kids out there who are worried about not being accepted for who they are: I want you to know that we’re here for you, we support you, and that we will always stand by you.
Thank you. 
",Prime Minister’s remarks on measures in place to support Canadians during COVID-19,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/06/26/prime-ministers-remarks-measures-place-support-canadians-during-covid-19
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-25,"Hello everyone.
I hope everyone had a good Saint-Jean-Baptiste and Fête nationale du Québec yesterday.
For a lot of Quebecers, St-Jean marks the beginning of summer.
Students are facing unique challenges this summer due to the pandemic. At the same time, many are wondering how they can help in the fight against COVID-19.
The reality is, there aren’t as many student jobs as there were last year.
And, without a job, it’s hard to pay tuition or everyday expenses.
So, in April, we announced a $9-billion plan to help students and new graduates.
This included the Canada Emergency Student Benefit, which will provide students with at least $1,250 a month until August.
We also said that we were going to create 76,000 jobs for young people in sectors that need help right now and introduce a program to award scholarships to those who got involved in their communities.
Today, we are following up on that commitment.
We’re launching the new Canada Student Service Grant, which will allow post-secondary students and recent grads to gain valuable experience while also contributing to their communities.
If you’re a college or university student or if you just graduated and you decide to volunteer this summer, you could get a grant of between $1,000 and $5,000.
The exact amount will depend on how many hours you’ve completed between June 25 and October 31.
To learn more about this program and find opportunities near you, you can head to the Government of Canada website, where today we launched the new I Want to Help portal.
Our government will also invest $40 million to create 5,000 internships through Mitacs for post-secondary students as part of our $9-billion plan to help students during this crisis.
Mitacs is an NGO that builds partnerships between universities and industry. With their training programs, internships, and projects, they help shape the next generation of innovators.
Usually, Mitacs caters to Master’s or PhD research students, but with the funding we’re announcing today, they’ll expand their internship opportunities to undergraduate students and students in professional programs like law, medicine, or business.
For example, one of their new programs will connect MBA students to small businesses that are facing challenges because of the pandemic.
The funding will also allow Mitacs to partner with more organizations like hospitals, foundations, and municipal governments to create even more opportunities for young people.
This is good news, not only for students, who will be able to put their knowledge to good use, but also for business owners and the future of Canada.
Innovation is becoming increasingly essential to the global economy.
If we want to build a strong and resilient economy, we have to invest in the next generation.
We have to make sure our young people have the right tools to work, innovate, and succeed in the economy of the future.
In this vein, our government will invest in Canada Summer Jobs to create 10,000 new job placements for young people aged between 15 and 30.
We will also support an additional 20,000 job placements for post-secondary students in highdemand sectors through the Student Work Placement Program.
And to make sure young people are prepared for the jobs of tomorrow, we’re investing in the Digital Skills for Youth and the Computer for Schools Plus programs.
Minister Bains will have more to say on this later, but here’s the bottom line.
There are fewer jobs, and many co-op, internship, and community service placements have been cancelled because of the pandemic.
So, if you’re a student and new grad, we’re creating tens of thousands of jobs for you.
We’re making sure that you can still learn new skills, gain valuable work experience, make money for the year ahead, and contribute to your community.
Over the years, Canada has established itself as a world leader in innovation.
Our researchers and scientists are recognized around the world for their advances in the fields of aerospace, artificial intelligence, clean technologies, and health.
And since the beginning of the crisis, we have been able to count on them to help us protect people’s health.
That’s why we launched a research funding competition in April to mitigate the spread of the virus and its impact on our communities.
Today, we can announce that we will be supporting 139 research team across the country. This represents a total investment of nearly $110 million in COVID-19 research in the coming year.
Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen our hard work and sacrifices start to pay off.
And to continue on the right track, we need to be thinking not just about the next weeks, but about the next months and even years.
That’s what we’re doing with today’s investments.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-22,"Hello, everyone.
Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge all those who have been affected by the forest fires in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean.
This is happening in already a difficult time.
We are thinking of you.
And to all the firefighters and first responders who are working to contain the fires and protect people—thank you.
Although this has been a very tough few months, for many people, it’s starting to feel like we’ve turned a corner.
Businesses are reopening their doors to serve their communities.
Employers are putting new precautions in place to keep people safe.
And right across the country, business owners are using the wage subsidy to get back on their feet, and rehire their employees.
By using this benefit, employers have helped 2.6 million Canadians stay in the workplace.
These are jobs that people rely on to pay their bills, and to put food on the table.
Jobs that matter to Canadians and to their families.
Take Romer’s in Vancouver and Port Moody: they used the wage subsidy to rehire over 150 employees, and reopen their three neighbourhood restaurants.
Or Enable Education in Milton, who applied for the benefit, and were able to keep a team of 18 people employed and busy.
And that’s what this program is all about.
But even as things start to improve for many people, we also have to remember that some industries have been hit harder than others.
And if you work in one of those sectors, it might take longer to find a job.
In the coming weeks, we want you to be able to focus on finding work, not be worrying about your benefits.
Over the past few months, we have created a series of programs to help Canadians get through this difficult time.
Since the beginning, we have said that as the situation evolves, our response would evolve with it.
So, as I announced on Tuesday, we are extending the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
This help will continue to be there for you and your family.
We understand the challenges people are facing and want to give them enough time to find a job.
Of course, going back to work is not always simple.
With businesses retooling their operations to produce hand sanitizer, and people finding creative ways to stay safe, the last few months have shown us the power of thinking outside the box.
We are making several resources available to you, should you have any questions about procedures and measures to follow during the reopening.
The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety has just published a series of public health fact sheets on its website that are an excellent source of information.
It has also launched an online space where businesses can share their experience and best practices, from tips on how to wear masks to advice on how to disinfect workplaces.
Going forward, that will serve us very well.
But by working together—as governments, businesses, and individuals—we will get through this.
Because finding new ways of doing things, and collaborating between sectors, yields great results.
In fact, for tech and agriculture, we’ve already seen that potential in action.
As people around the world start eating more plant-based products, we have an opportunity to bring together Canadian innovation and Canadian crops, and a chance to create good, well-paying jobs.
We’ve already invested in this space, with the Prairies-based Protein Industries Supercluster, supporting thousands of jobs.
But this industry is growing fast, so we’re not stopping there. 
Today, I can announce that our government is contributing almost $100 million for the new Merit Functional Foods location in Winnipeg.
This facility will be a world leader in plant-based proteins, and will create good jobs in a fast-growing field.
And by using 100 per cent Canadian inputs, it will also support farmers who produce the canola and yellow peas used in Merit’s products.
Standing up for hardworking farmers, creating good jobs, setting up Canada for success on the world stage – these are things that our government will always get behind.
I want to end this morning by talking about Canada’s actions at the international level.
This pandemic has revealed gaps that persist and still affect far too many people around the world.  
Of course, for many women and girls, health care inequalities are nothing new—this is their reality on a daily basis.
Even today, women and girls still have to fight for basic health care and die of preventable diseases.
And far too often, women’s right to make decisions about their own bodies is questioned.
Since our mandate began, we have made gender equality central to everything we do.
And that’s what we are continuing to do today.
This morning, Minister Gould is taking part in the She Decides Now conference and announcing that our government will invest nearly $94 million to support the sexual and reproductive health and rights of the world’s most vulnerable women and girls.
This funding will help support a range of services, from helping professionally trained and certified midwives in Somalia, to addressing gender-based violence in Rohingya refugee camps.
If this pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge for our country, it has also been an important opportunity.
To figure out what really matters in our communities.
To have meaningful conversations about how we can take care of those around us.
And perhaps above all, to think about what kind of future we want to build together.
We have the chance to shape our country and our world for the better.
And I know that we’re up to that task.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-19,"Hello everyone.
This morning, I am at the Biscotti &amp; Cie café and restaurant in Chelsea, in the Outaouais region.
A few moments ago, I had the chance to speak with the owner, Manuela, about the challenges she is facing because of the pandemic.
In addition to Biscotti &amp; Cie, Manuela also heads the Chelsea Pub and the Lofts du Village, a hotel project opening later this year.
Restaurants and tourism are obviously two of the sectors that have been hardest hit by the crisis.
And, like a lot of entrepreneurs across the country, Manuela had to slow down her business and make a number of changes to continue serving her customers.
At Biscotti &amp; Cie, they changed their menu to make it easier to order take-out and put new protocols in place to protect their customers and employees.
But buying personal protective equipment and making delivery arrangements, on top of buying food, and paying bills and employees—it’s expensive.
All across the country, a lot of people are experiencing the same thing.
Business was going well and then, all of a sudden, the pandemic forced businesses and restaurants to close. Entrepreneurs had to delay or even cancel their plans and projects.
Our government understands how difficult this situation is, so we have created a number of programs to help people get through this crisis.
For example, Manuela used the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to rehire close to 75 employees. And with the reopening of the Chelsea Pub’s patio and dining room, she thinks she may be able to rehire even more people.
Manuela is also benefitting from a rent reduction thanks to the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance.
Small business owners create jobs, fuel the growth of our economy, and enrich our communities. 
And our government is here for them when they need help the most.
As we start to reopen parts of the economy, our government will continue to be there to help Canadians get back on their feet.
And we’re making progress every day.
In April, we announced a $9-billion plan to help students and recent grads get through the crisis.
An important part of this plan was to create jobs for young people in sectors that need an extra hand and today, I have some good news to share.
We’re creating 500 green jobs and training opportunities for young people in STEM in the energy, forestry, mining, earth sciences, and clean technology sectors.
Ranging from six months to a year in length, these internships will give young people invaluable work experience and the chance to explore careers in the natural resource sector.
As life starts getting back to normal, Canadians can count on our government to continue working with the provinces and territories to bring in the right measures to keep Canadians safe and healthy, and reopen the economy safely. 
We talked about the Government’s proposal to provide $14 billion to address critical needs across the country over the coming six to eight months.
This is money that could be used to offer more childcare spaces, increase testing and contact tracing, and keep people safe on the job.
We want to work with the provinces and territories to implement these measures as soon as possible and make sure we don’t lose the progress we’ve made.
We also talked about the upcoming launch of a new nationwide mobile app to provide notifications of exposure to COVID-19.
As I mentioned yesterday, we will soon begin testing the app in Ontario, but it will be available to everyone across the country in the coming weeks.
I want to end today by reminding everyone that Sunday is Father’s Day.
This is always a special time to get together with family and enjoy the warm weather – two things we’ve been missing over the past few months.
All provinces and territories have started loosening some restrictions that probably make it easier to celebrate with dad this weekend.
As you start making plans, please be sure to follow the public health guidelines for your region.
This is the best way to keep you, your dad, and the whole family safe, and have a great time on Sunday.
And to all the dads out there – happy Father’s Day!

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-18,"Hello everyone.
I want to start by congratulating all of the new, non-permanent members of the UN Security Council. And although Canada isn’t one of them, I want to take a moment to talk about our work on the file.
As Canadians know, we embarked on this journey four years ago now.
We decided to throw our hat in the ring because we saw a unique opportunity to engage with our partners across the UN, build sustainable peace, and make real progress on issues that matter to Canadians.
And that’s what we’ve done during this campaign.
We forged new partnerships, we strengthened existing friendships, and we laid a solid foundation for an even greater collaboration in the future.
And that’s never been more critical.
Now more than ever, global cooperation is crucial not only to defeat this virus, but to address the great challenges of our time – challenges that transcend borders.
Growing our economies, mitigating the impacts of climate change, building a lasting peace, advancing gender equality, protecting our citizens – we have to engage with partners to achieve these goals.
Getting this seat was never an end in itself, but rather a means to an end. A means to ensure that our voice was heard and that our values were upheld on the world stage.
The bid was certainly one way to achieve this, but it’s far from the only way.
Moving forward, Canadians can count on us to keep working with our partners to make progress internationally on issues that matter to them.
Across the country, we’re starting to reopen parts of the economy and that’s welcome news for everyone.
But as we start loosening some restrictions, we also have to strengthen other measures so that we don’t lose the progress we’ve made.
As some people start heading back to work, testing and contact tracing is crucial.
That’s why we’ve been working with the provinces and territories to ensure that they have everything they need to keep people safe and healthy.
And today, we’re taking an important step forward toward containing the virus and safely restarting the economy.
Led by the Canadian Digital Service, and with the help of Shopify, Blackberry, and the Government of Ontario, we’ve been working on a nationwide mobile app that will notify users if they’ve been exposed to COVID-19.
We will soon begin testing this app in Ontario. There are already a number of other provinces, including B.C., who are working with us on this, but it will be available to everyone in the coming weeks.
Premier Ford will have more to say on how the app will work in Ontario later today, but I want to thank him and his government for their leadership and partnership.
Now, I want to stress that this app will be completely voluntary.
It’ll be up to individual Canadians to decide whether to download the app or not.
But the app will be most effective when as many people as possible have it.
Here’s how it’s going to work.
If you test positive for COVID-19, a health-care professional will help you upload your status anonymously to a national network.
Other users who have the app and have been in proximity to you will then be alerted that they’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive.
The notification will encourage them to reach out to their local public health authorities.
At no time will personal information be collected or shared, and no location services will be used.
The privacy of Canadians will be fully respected.
Over the past few weeks, we have started reopening some parts of the economy.
But this presents specific challenges for different sectors.
I am thinking, for example, of the cultural industry.
Since the beginning of the crisis, our government has been there for artists, creators, and workers in this sector.
The Canada Council for the Arts estimates that, in total, the cultural industry has received over $2.5 billion, notably through programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
In April, we provided $500 million to support our artists, our creators, and our rising sports stars. I can announce that we are today launching an online portal to speed up the processing of these applications.
Organizations that want to obtain funding can now apply on the government’s site.
We are making significant progress, but we know there is still work to be done.
Over the past few months, our museums have experienced major revenue losses, which is threatening a lot of people’s jobs.
Our government has therefore decided to invest an additional $25.7 million to maintain nearly 200 jobs in seven national museums across the country.
Our museums tell our stories, celebrate our artists, and enrich our communities.
The people working in these institutions are preserving our Canadian heritage.
They help us to learn about our past and to discover those who have left their mark on our country.
Since the beginning of the crisis, our government has been closely monitoring the spread of the virus, its impacts on our economy, and making the right adjustments along the way.
We’re going to keep listening to Canadians and look for other ways to support them as the situation evolves.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-17,"Hello everyone.
Before we get started, I want to recognize the great work that all of Team Canada has done ahead of today’s United Nations Security Council vote.
We’re running for the Security Council seat because we saw a unique opportunity to engage with our partners across the UN, to build sustainable peace, and to make real progress on the issues that matter.
Around the world, people want many of the same things:
Clean air, a real shot at success, a fair economy, and a just society.
And to make that happen, we have to work together.
Today, and every day, that is something that our government is ready to do.
At the beginning of the year, I don’t think anyone could have predicted what the coming months would hold.
COVID-19 is truly an unprecedented challenge.
And right from the start, it was clear that we needed to put everything we had on the table in response.  
So that’s exactly what our government did.  
In the space of a few weeks, we introduced the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
We created loans for small businesses and put in place support for specific sectors that had been hardest hit.
We rolled out help for seniors, for students, for families.
And every step of the way, we kept Canadians up to date about what we were doing to respond.
Taken together, we’ve now introduced the largest economic measures in our lifetimes – measures that are helping millions of people.
Because that’s what the situation demanded.
Now, as we begin to safely and gradually restart, I know people are wondering what this pandemic will mean for their jobs in the long-run, and what the impact has been on our economy and on our path forward.
We hear that, and we want to make sure that you have the best information possible. 
So today, I can announce that in the House of Commons on July 8, our government will be releasing an economic and fiscal snapshot.
This will give Canadians a picture of where our economy is right now, how our response compares to that of other countries, and what we can expect for the months to come.
Later today, Minister Morneau will formally announce in Parliament that we will be presenting this economic and fiscal snapshot.
Adopting measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis on our economy is just part of the challenge.
We are also working very hard to ensure that hospitals and front-line workers have the equipment and supplies they need.
And I have some good news to share on that front.
First, our government signed an agreement with Montréal-based Galenvs to produce silica beads, which are essential for testing.
And this week, Health Canada also certified ventilators produced by two Canadian groups: CAE and the Ventilators for Canadians consortium.  
They will now be able to increase their production to manufacture the 20,000 ventilators ordered.
Two years ago, I visited CAE to announce an investment in worker training.
Today, we see why it’s so important to support both Canadian talent and Canadian innovation.
Researchers across the country make incredible discoveries every day, from rapid advances in understanding COVID-19 over the last few months, to years-long studies of climate change and cancer treatments.
It’s in everyone’s interest that they continue doing their vital work.
So today, we’re announcing almost $500 million in funding through NSERC’s annual Discovery Grants Program.
This money will support thousands of Canadian researchers and their groundbreaking work, whether they’re studying viruses, developing AI, or making strides in chemical engineering.
Canadians are innovative and creative, and that’s something we’ll always support.
This morning, I want to speak about help for another group of Canadians who do vital work: our fish and seafood producers.
The women and men who work on fishing boats and in processing plants keep our families fed.
But they’ve been facing some really tough times lately.
That’s why in the next week, we’re opening applications for two additional programs to support the sector.
As of today, the Canadian Fish and Seafood Opportunities Fund is available to help producers access new markets, reach new customers, and maintain a foothold internationally.
Canada’s seafood is among the best in the world and this fund will help spread the word.
On Monday, processors will also be able to apply for help through the Canadian Seafood Stabilization Fund we created this spring.
The fund will provide support for everything from buying PPE to keeping workers safe, to purchasing freezers so products stay good while producers find buyers.
I want to end today with an update on Parks Canada. 
For a lot of people, no summer is complete without getting the tent packed, the kids in the car, and the time off to go camping.
Now, because of the pandemic, many campgrounds had to close temporarily.
But the good news is that as of Monday, Parks Canada will gradually start reopening some of their camping sites.
No matter what you’re planning this summer – whether it’s camping or barbeques – keep following public health recommendations, and keep doing your part to protect the people around you.
Together, we will get through this.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks announcing additional research funding and support for Canadians,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/06/17/prime-ministers-remarks-announcing-additional-research-funding-and-support
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-16,"Hello everyone.
Over the past few months, we’ve introduced programs that are making a real difference in the lives of millions of people right across the country.
Take the Rose and Crown, a pub in Canmore, Alberta.
As they were getting ready to welcome customers again, they used the wage subsidy to rehire 15 employees.
And they got a loan through the Canada Emergency Business Account so they could buy personal protective equipment, plexiglass screens, and additional hand washing stations to comply with public health guidelines.
That’s good news for the people who are now back on the job, and for the locals who missed their favourite neighbourhood spot.
When this crisis first began, a lot of people lost their jobs overnight.
They didn’t know how they were going to feed their families or pay their bills.
So, our government responded rapidly and substantially to support Canadians with programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
Three months later, we’re beginning to see across the country that we’re now in a place where we’re gradually and safely starting to restart parts of the economy.
But I’m not going to sugarcoat it.
We still have a long journey ahead.
Some sectors will bounce back more quickly than others. Many workers will be able to find work, but others won’t.
And the reality is that even as we start to reopen, a lot of people still need this support to pay their bills while they look for work.
That’s why today, I am announcing that we will be extending eligibility for the CERB by eight weeks.
So, if you’ve been getting the CERB and you still can’t work – because you are unable to find a job or it’s just not possible – you will keep getting that $2,000 per four-week period.
Over the next few weeks, our government will look at international best practices, and monitor the economy and the progression of the virus, to see what changes – if any – need to be made to the program so that more people are properly supported.
But I want to be very clear with Canadians.
Our goal here is to make sure that the CERB is working for you in the best way possible.
Our government will continue to be there for you.
This pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for our country.
And we’re going to make sure that all our supports, including the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and Employment Insurance, are working effectively to get Canadians back on their feet.
That’s also a big part of the reason why I proposed to support the provinces and territories with $14 billion to make sure that you have childcare, that there’s testing and tracing, and that your workplace is safe.
As the situation evolves, so too must our response evolve with it.
And that’s what we’re going to keep doing.
I want to close this morning with some news regarding the Canada-U.S. border.
I can now confirm that Canada and the United States have once again agreed to extend by 30 days, until July 21, the current measures in place along our border.
This is an important decision that will keep people in both of our countries safe as we continue fighting COVID-19.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on the extension of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/06/16/prime-ministers-remarks-extension-canada-emergency-response-benefit
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-15,"Hello everyone.
Whether it’s to cover the bills, to keep people on the payroll, or to make rent on a storefront, many Canadians need a hand right now.
So over the past few months, we’ve brought in new programs that are doing exactly that.
Just take the wage subsidy, and what it has meant for people like the employees at Euro-line in Oakville.
This family-owned appliance business had to close their operations and lay off staff because of the pandemic.
It was a really tough spring.
But when they applied for the wage subsidy, they were able to then rehire their entire team.
And that matters to the 22 people who now have their paycheque again.
To all employers:
Please use the wage subsidy, if you haven’t already.
This help is designed for you and your employees.
And if you need more support, apply for the Canada Emergency Business Account.
On the CEBA in particular, I want to remind everyone that we recently expanded the eligibility for this program to include even more small businesses, like farmers.
The new application process will open on Friday, and in the coming days we’ll have more information to share about it.
In the last few weeks, things have started to look up for a lot of people.
But that said, we also know that far too many Canadians are still struggling.
If you’re having trouble finding a job, you shouldn’t also be worrying about whether you’ll hit the limit of your CERB benefits.
So right now, we’re working on a solution to extend the benefit for people who can’t return to work yet.
We’ll have more details later this week, but for today, I want you to know that we will continue to be there for you and your family.  
During National Public Service Week, I want to thank all the women and men who work incredibly hard to get Canadians the help they need.
Especially recently, they’ve done a remarkable job for their fellow Canadians.
No one could have predicted that this spring would turn out the way that it did.
Certainly for farmers, who keep our grocery stores stocked and our families fed, it’s been an unexpectedly challenging few months.
With restaurants and hotels closed for weeks, many producers were left with extra food they couldn’t sell.
Farmers work hard to raise their livestock and grow their crops.
They shouldn’t be in a position where they have to see that wasted.
And that’s why today, we are opening applications for the Surplus Food Rescue Program.
This program will help get products that farmers and fishers can’t sell – whether that’s potatoes, poultry, or seafood, or otherwise – to communities that need it.
People across the country will benefit, including in remote, northern communities.
This is a win-win.
Farmers will have people to buy their goods, and food will get to the plates of families who wouldn’t have enough otherwise.
In many ways, COVID-19 is a challenge like we’ve never dealt with before.
But it certainly isn’t the only test we’re facing.
In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, we need to think outside the box, in order to keep people safe, to grow our economy, and to shape our future for the better.
Artificial intelligence has the potential to be an incredibly powerful force for good.
But it must be used responsibly and ethically. And on that front, Canada is continuing to lead the way forward.
Today, as one of 13 founding members, Canada helped launch the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence.
As part of this initiative, we’ve also worked with the Government of Québec to set up a centre of expertise in Montréal, which will be one of the partnership’s two global hubs.
This country is home to some of the world’s most innovative people, not to mention the fact that Canadians have pioneered much of today’s AI tech.
It only makes sense to put that expertise to use.
Earlier this morning, I also joined Minister Ng and her counterparts in the Ottawa Group on World Trade Organization reform.
We discussed our work together on trade, on safeguarding international supply chains, and on building a global economy that works for everyone.
Now more than ever, it is vital that we collaborate across borders to keep our economies strong and our citizens safe.
This pandemic is a global crisis – and it requires global solutions.
So in response to a request from the United Nations, I can also announce that Canada will provide airlift support for urgently-needed medical and humanitarian supplies.
Through this mission, we will be delivering help to some of the world’s most vulnerable people.
I would also like to point out that today is World Elder Abuse Awareness Day.
Our parents, our grandparents, and our elders built this country.
We must protect them and ensure they receive the care they deserve.
On that note, let me give a big shout-out to the Rogers Foundation for their $60 million donation to help the most vulnerable during this pandemic.
I know this incredible initiative will have a huge impact on a whole lot of people’s lives. 
Whether you decide call your grandparents or ask your neighbours how they’re doing, we must all do our part.
In my Papineau riding, the AMI roundtable does incredible work to prevent the mistreatment of seniors all year long.
I want to acknowledge and thank all those who work for similar organizations all across the country.
Thank you for taking care of our seniors.
Today, and every day, we must all work together to ensure the health and safety of Canadians of all ages.
I want to end this morning by recognizing the Canadian troops who arrived in Ukraine yesterday to resume their training mission.
The work they’re doing together with our partners to build a more secure country is incredibly important.
I know all Canadians will be thinking of these brave women and men in uniform, as they serve overseas.
Thank you very much.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-12,"Hello, everyone.  
I would like to begin this morning with an update on the deployment of Canadian Armed Forces members to long-term care facilities in Quebec.
Over the past few months, our government has been working with the provinces on providing care for seniors and the most vulnerable.
This includes by deploying members of the Canadian Armed Forces to certain long-term care facilities.
Our women and men in uniform are doing a remarkable job and are saving lives.
Since the end of April, the situation in several long-term care facilities has stabilized.
And many attendants are returning to work.
This means that the Canadian Armed Forces members who were deployed to a long-term care facility where things have improved can now go lend a hand in other centres where the situation is more critical.
This has allowed us to help over 35 long-term care facilities to date, and we will continue to redeploy Canadian Armed Forces members from facilities that are under control to new centres in need.
I want to be clear: the 1,400 Canadian Armed Forces members involved in Operation LASER are still in Quebec and are currently being redeployed to the long-term care facilities that are most in need.
Their help is still needed, so we’re making sure that our elders continue to have this vital support.
We are continuing our discussions with Quebec to develop a medium-term plan that will allow us to support the efforts until September 15.
The plan includes the active participation of the Canadian Red Cross with well-trained, paid people who will be as effective as the Canadian Armed Forces members.
The federal government will continue to be there for Quebecers.
To restart the economy, to get Canadians back on their feet, we need a coordinated, countrywide plan.
And at the heart of this approach must be how we do this safely.
In country after country, state after state, a pattern is emerging.
People make sacrifices needed to flatten the curve, but then, when governments decide to restart the economy, cases begin to rise again.
And after months of hard work, people are finding themselves right back where they started.  
Canada must learn from these lessons.
It’s clear that we have to make safety and control of this virus a top priority in this restart.
So that’s exactly what we’re doing.
Our government is working with the provinces and territories to bring in the right measures to keep Canadians safe and healthy. 
Last week, I put forward our government’s commitment – $14 billion towards a safe restart agreement, for the things that Canadians will need in the six months ahead.
At our meeting yesterday, the premiers, the Deputy Prime Minister, and I continued our discussion on what this plan might look like.
We talked about the measures needed, whether that’s childcare and paid sick leave, contact tracing and testing, or PPE, and support for the most vulnerable.
And we talked about the fact that we must keep working together to support Canadians right across the country.
Last night, the premiers and I also discussed the reports and videos that are now circulating, showing violence against Black Canadians and Indigenous people.
All levels of government need to work together to ensure that things change as quickly as possible.
We’ve all now seen the shocking video of Chief Adam’s arrest, and we must get to the bottom of this.
Like many people, I have serious questions about what happened.
The independent investigation must be transparent and be carried out so that we get answers.
At the same time though, we also know that this is not an isolated incident.
Far too many Black Canadians and Indigenous people do not feel safe around police.
It’s unacceptable.
And as governments, we have to change that.
In my discussion with the premiers yesterday evening, I brought this up.
All leaders were united in condemning racism, and in agreeing that we must do more to combat it.
I raised with them some of the ways we can work together moving forward, including on practical things like the adoption of body cameras.
This is something I’ve already discussed with RCMP Commissioner Lucki.
But, reforms are needed at all levels of policing, and these reforms need to happen quickly.
In the days and weeks to come, our government will continue to move as fast as we can with all of our partners.  
Women and men who serve in our police forces must be part of the solution.
They are people who’ve stepped up to serve their community.  
And they will be invaluable allies as we move forward to make sure that all Canadians are well served by these institutions.
Today, I also want to speak about the progress we’re making on travel, and on our work to keep Canadians safe.
Right now, physical distancing is still the best way to protect yourself and others.
Of course, there are some places, like on flights, where it’s not always possible to keep two metres apart.
That’s exactly why we’ve made it mandatory for travellers and staff to wear masks.
Our government is also looking at the new best practices in place around the world to protect people.
We’ve also worked with airlines and airports on standards they should have in place, whether that’s enhanced cleaning, or putting distancing measures as people wait in line.
And today, I can announce that we’re taking another step forward.
Our government is mandating temperature screening for air passengers through a phased approach, first for those travelling to Canada, then for those travelling from Canada, and finally for those travelling within Canada. 
A passenger who has a fever will not be permitted to board their flight.
Employees in the secured areas of airports will also be required to have their temperature checked.
There are strong measures already in place to keep people safe and this screening will add yet another layer of protection.
I know that Minister Garneau will have more to say about this later today.
Over the coming weeks and months, we will continue to explore other ways of protecting Canadians and limiting the spread of this virus.
Right across the country, in every city and town, Canadians are stepping up to help. 
If you want a great example, look no further than the Filipino-Canadian community.
In Surrey, the community set up a blood donation drive as their way to pitch in.
In Calgary, an organization called Fiesta Filipinos is raising money for care packages for families.
In Montréal, the Filipino community set up a meals on wheels program to deliver food to seniors who live alone or are confined.
Today, on Philippine Independence Day, we recognize all the contributions that Canadians of Filipino origin have made to Canada.
It is also an opportunity to address the obstacles this community continues to face.
As we celebrate Filipino Heritage Month, we can’t ignore the ways in which our country must do better.
Too many members of this community face discrimination, something that has gotten worse because of this pandemic.
There is no place in this country for racism against Asian Canadians, or anybody else.
Now, more than ever, we need to stand up against discrimination and injustice in all its forms.
As Canadians, we are always stronger together.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-11,"Hello, everyone.
Before I get started this morning, I want to talk about what happened in the House of Commons yesterday.
Our government tabled legislation that would, among other things, provide a much-needed, one-time payment of up to $600 for Canadians with disabilities.
To make sure this support could move forward, we separated the measures for people with disabilities from everything else in that legislation.
I want to take a moment to speak to everyone who lives with a disability, or cares for someone with a disability.
We will not give up.
We’re not going to let you be left behind.
And we’ll keep working to get you the help you need and deserve.
This morning, it’s great to be here at Régimbal Awards and Promotions, along with Minister Mona Fortier.
I’ve just had a chance to meet some of the employees, who showed me the new process they’re running for printing patterns on face masks.
As Luc here explained, this isn’t what their family business normally does.
When COVID-19 hit, they decided to pitch in.
They’ve already helped supply thousands of masks to people across Ottawa.
On top of that, they’re also contributing to the Ottawa Community Foundation’s COVID-19 Rapid Response Fund, and donating buttons that make wearing a mask more comfortable for doctors and nurses.
All across the country, we have seen small business owners step up and do their part.
But we cannot forget that we are going through a difficult time and that a lot of people need help at this time.
That is why our government is working around the clock to give businesses the support they need.
Whether it’s with the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy or business loans, our priority has always been to help employers stay in business and keep their employees.
For this family business, just like so many others, the pandemic hit hard.
They had to go down to three employees, and they were worried about making ends meet.
Today, because they used the wage subsidy, this business is now back to 16 staff members.
I want to thank them for stepping up and using this program not only to stay up and running, but to protect people’s jobs.
Businesses like this, which use the support available, will help Canadians get through this tough time.
Because in addition to the wage subsidy, they’ve also accessed the Canada Emergency Business Account and the rent assistance.
And that gives this family business the confidence they need to keep their doors open and keep people on the payroll.
Small businesses are the backbone of our communities and the lifeblood of our economy.
So, as we look to restart and get Canadians back on their feet, making sure small businesses have the support they need will be key.
And on that front, this week we’ve taken yet another step forward.
This initiative calls on businesses to commit to five key public health measures – like physical distancing and handwashing – to protect customers and employees.
I encourage all business owners – whether you have a restaurant, a tech start-up, or a boutique – to join in today at postpromise.com.
Together, we can keep people safe.
And together, we can give Canadians the confidence that’s needed to restart our economy.
With this initiative and others, we’re making progress.
That said, we know there’s still more to do.
For many Indigenous businesses, the last few months have been extremely difficult.
We hear that.
So today, we’re investing an additional $133 million to support Indigenous businesses, protect jobs, and help communities weather this storm.
Of this funding, $117 million will help small and community-owned Indigenous businesses get through this tough time.
And our government will provide $16 million to support Indigenous businesses in the tourism industry, a sector that supports thousands of jobs across the country.
The goal is to help as many people as possible.  
I know Minister Miller will have more details to share about all of this later today.
Any plan to restart the economy must look at supporting businesses and workers.
But it has to go beyond that, too.
To move forward, we also need to make sure that our communities have the resources to keep providing the services Canadians need.
Last week, I announced that we would accelerate funding for municipalities.
Today, Minister McKenna is publicly releasing the amounts of funding that will be available for communities.
Our government has already delivered this money to the provinces and territories, so that it can get it out to cities and towns as soon as possible.
Providing municipalities with funding sooner than expected is just one part of the plan our government will be implementing to restart the economy safely and effectively across the country.
During the meeting with the provincial and territorial premiers later today, we will be discussing the next steps.
Last week, our government indicated that it was prepared to invest $14 billion in a safe restart agreement.
This money would help pay for everything we will need in the coming months.
This evening, we will be discussing what this safe restart will include, whether it’s funding for childcare, paid sick leave, the purchase of personal protective equipment, or support for those who are most vulnerable.
I want to end this morning by recognizing that yesterday, across Canada, many people took time out to celebrate Portugal Day.
This week, throughout Portuguese Heritage Month, we have a chance to celebrate the many ways that Luso-Canadians have made our country a stronger and better place.
Look no further than Nosso Talho in Toronto, a Portuguese grocery store that’s dropping off food to people who are struggling because of this pandemic.
The Portuguese community recognizes the value of family and the importance of hard work, and it has given so much to our neighbourhoods and cities.
I would like to thank all Canadians of Portuguese heritage for their many contributions, and I wish you all a wonderful Portuguese Heritage Month.
Communities of diverse backgrounds across the country continue to step up.
And I want to thank everyone who’s doing that for understanding that the way we get through this, is by getting through this together.
Thank you very much.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-10,"Hello everyone.
First, congratulations are in order.
You’ve worked so hard, for so many years, to get to graduation day and you should all be very proud of yourselves.
But let’s be real.
This day is nothing like you imagined it to be. And the world is a much different place than anyone could have predicted even a year ago.
It’s tough.
You should be celebrating with your friends, taking pictures in your gowns, attending the ceremony on campus.
Walking across the stage to get your diploma, waiting for the commencement speaker to finish their speech, and thinking about the parties that you’ll be attending later that night.
But this year is different.
You are different.
No student gets to choose the world into which they graduate, but if you could – and let’s be honest here – you probably wouldn’t have chosen the world of 2020.
The Australian bushfires linked to climate change. The horrific plane crash in Iran. The worst mass shooting in our country’s history. Horrifying scenes of police violence against Black people and Indigenous peoples.
And of course, the reason we’re all gathered here today virtually and not in person—COVID-19, which has triggered the greatest health and economic crisis in generations.
Recent events have brought a lot of hardship and uncertainty to your lives. And you’ve had to make unprecedented sacrifices.
You’ve had to totally rethink the coming months, the normal stresses of graduating, and next steps have just reached a whole new level.
2020 has also exposed the limitations and flaws of our world—the world that you are set to inherit.
That can be unsettling, and even alarming.
But it’s also a wake-up call.
A wake-up call on how much you are needed.
Because here’s the thing.
Your generation has acutely sensed what was wrong with the world, and what needed to be fixed.
You marched for climate change.
You had the courage to say “Me Too.”
You pushed us along the road to reconciliation.
You stood up because Black Lives Matter.
You demanded the freedom to love who you love. To be who you are.
Make no mistake. Getting a degree is a momentous achievement.
But you never needed a piece of paper to call out injustice.
You didn’t wait for this day to demand change. To create change.
Very few graduating classes in living memory will have faced a challenge of this magnitude, but the Class of 1939 comes to mind.
The Greatest Generation came out of the Depression to fight a world war that they didn’t start. And in the face of unprecedented destruction, they chose to rebuild the world, by rolling up their sleeves and pulling together. 
They built the institutions that carried us through the second half of the 20th century.
They set the world on a path of more solidarity, more compassion, more understanding.
They sacrificed a lot, they dreamed big, they worked hard, and they left us a world far better than they found it.
The challenge facing the Class of 2020 is not dissimilar.
The choices you will make – both big and small – in the next few years will decide the future of our country and of our world.
And I cannot think of a generation better prepared to set us on the right path forward.
COVID-19 has taken many things away from you, least of which is a proper graduation. The last few months have been incredibly frustrating.
But this pandemic is also teaching us important lessons.
For one, it’s taught us just how much we need one another.
To defeat this virus, everyone has to play their part—and young people have stepped up.
You’ve made real sacrifices to protect your elders.
You finished your degree online.
You haven’t hugged a friend, let alone had a date, in months.
And you’ve chosen to help out your parents, your neighbours, your community during this tough time.
Whether you’re volunteering with a local charity or helping a business adapt to the new normal, you are stepping up.
You get it.
What matters most is looking out for the most vulnerable, understanding the impact of our choices on others, and being there for each other.
This is what these unprecedented times are teaching you. And reminding us all.
That friends matter. That the people around us matter.
It’s time that we reclaim the idea of community, of being a good neighbour, of being a good friend both online and in real life.
That is something you are uniquely prepared to achieve.
You grew up seeing and engaging with people online who may not speak the same language as you or carry the same passport as you do, but who share your values, your outrage, your passion.
You came of age during events like Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, the Quebec student protests, Idle No More, and the rise of populism and nativism around the Western world.
More recently, you’ve echoed the calls for democracy in Hong Kong. You’ve amplified the calls for more justice, more accountability, and more equality sparked in Minneapolis.
You understand not just the value, but the power, of community better than most.
And that’s why I trust that you will be the 21st century’s greatest generation.
You know what is wrong with the world and how to fix it.
Your job is not only to challenge people like me, but to bring us along.
The road ahead will not be an easy one.
There will be setbacks, disappointments, and heartbreak along the way.
But you have everything you need to achieve what you set your mind to.
You’re incredibly smart, skilled, creative, and ambitious.
You’re also passionate, kind, and empathetic.
And you’re Canadian.
You are connected to, and welcomed in, almost every corner of the world.
You appreciate the opportunities, privileges, and responsibilities that come with calling this country home.
But you also know that Canada is far from perfect. That we are still very much a work in progress.
And your generation has enthusiastically embraced the hard truth that we have to do better.
That doesn’t take away the deep pride that comes with being Canadian.
In fact, our determination to improve, our willingness to learn, and our optimism about the future is at the heart of who we are as a country.
We all know that Canada didn’t happen by accident and won’t continue without effort.
And if there is such a thing as Canadian exceptionalism, it’s not the belief that Canada is the best country in the world.
It’s knowing that we could be.
That our work is never finished.
That our golden age is always ahead of us.
I know the future can seem especially daunting.
But believe me when I say you have everything you need not only to achieve, succeed, and build, but to be happy.
No one gets to choose the world into which they graduate.
But you do get to choose the world that will be your legacy.
You, the Class of 2020, are different.
You were always different.
Recent events have just opened our eyes to what was right in front of us all along.
That you care.
You care about each other.
You care about people you’ve never met and never will.
You care about what happens next.
I know you got this.
And so do you.
",Prime Minister’s commencement speech to post-secondary graduates,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/06/10/prime-ministers-commencement-speech-post-secondary-graduates
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-09,"Good morning everyone.
At the beginning of the crisis, our government announced a plan to mobilize industry so that we could quickly produce the items we need, right here in Canada.
Since then, companies from all across the country have volunteered to help us and we make significant progress every week.
I would therefore like to start today by providing an update.
First, we have signed a contract with GL Chemtec in Oakville to ensure the supply of chemical products that are essential to testing.
As certain activities start up again, we must strengthen other measures, like testing and contact tracing.
We must therefore ensure that our healthcare professionals have the right tools to administer more tests and analyze them.
We also signed two new contracts to make sure our frontline workers can continue to do their jobs safely.
Joseph Ribkoff, a clothing manufacturer based out of Dorval, will be providing us with 1.2 million made-in-Canada medical gowns, with deliveries starting in July.
And the Stevens Company, a medical supply distributor in Brampton, will be supplying 15 million shoe covers as well as 5 million disinfectant wipes, all made in Canada.
Over the past few months, our government has helped companies re-tool their manufacturing facilities and massively scale-up production to meet the demands of this crisis.
And I want to thank every entrepreneur and every worker who stepped up to contribute to this fight.
As we start to reopen and some people head back to work, the need for personal protective equipment and other essential supplies like hand sanitizer and disinfectant will continue to grow.
And we’re making sure we’re ready for that.
On Saturday, a ship carrying 160,000 litres of hand sanitizer arrived in Vancouver and we’re expecting seven more ships with hand sanitizer in the coming days.
We also have almost 1 million face shields and more than 7 million pairs of gloves on their way to the provinces and territories.
And, to connect businesses looking for PPE with suppliers, today we’re launching a PPE supply hub website.
We also created new, innovative procurement streams to allow more businesses to develop solutions and products Canadians need because of this pandemic.
We’ve always known that Canada is home to some of the best innovators in the world and it’s been great to see so many of them use their talent and know-how to help our communities during this crisis.
In April, we put out a call asking for creative, made-in-Canada prototypes that will help current and future outbreaks of COVID-19 and similar public health emergencies.
And, in just two weeks, we received over 550 proposals.
We will soon be selecting some prototypes for testing, and innovators will be able to work with the government to scale up production.
After spending the past few months at home, we are slowly starting to get back to normal.
We obviously have to remain very vigilant and continue following the health authorities’ guidelines, but some businesses can start reopening and that’s good news.
Neighbourhood stores, small businesses, and shopkeepers play an important role in our communities and we have missed them during the lockdown.
Now is the time to support them as much as possible, while being careful and wearing a mask if necessary.
Reopening presents a number of challenges for business owners.
After having closed up for several months, many of them are having trouble restarting their activities and rehiring their employees because they are having cash flow problems.
Over the past few weeks, as businesses get ready to reopen, more employers are using the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to rehire their employees.
Just take Track ‘N Trail in Edmonton.
Track ‘N Trail was well established in the community, selling outdoor clothing, equipment, and footwear for 36 years, but when the pandemic hit, they had to close down their stores.
After a number of challenging months, they’re now ready to welcome customers again.
And as part of getting their shops back up and running, they used the wage subsidy to help rehire their employees.
Shops, local entrepreneurs, and business owners are the backbone of our economy.
They make our towns and cities better places to call home.
And collectively, they are the largest employer in the country.
As we start to reopen, some businesses will need support to get back on their feet and our government will be there to help with programs like the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
I also want to remind people that we launched a hotline service to help entrepreneurs and small business owners, including not-for-profit organizations and charities, navigate these uncertain times.
People with pressing financial needs can now call 1-866-989-1080 to speak with an accountant or a business advisor.
During this pandemic, our government has been there for Canadians every step of the way, and we will continue to propose measures to support them.
On Saturday, we shared draft legislation with the opposition parties, which included additional proposals to help people.
This legislation will aim to provide direct support to people with disabilities, support more workers through the wage subsidy, and ensure that Canadians who aren’t able to meet certain judicial timelines, such as bankruptcy, aren’t unfairly punished.
We will also strive to make CERB payments more flexible, while making sure that those who knowingly and wrongfully claim the CERB face consequences.
Discussions are ongoing, but I fully expect us to be able to work well with the opposition to deliver this important support to Canadians.
The next few weeks will be busy as we begin restarting some activities, but, as always, you can count on our government as we move forward.
Thank you very much.
",Prime Minister’s remarks updating Canadians on Canada’s Plan to Mobilize Industry to fight COVID-19,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/06/09/prime-ministers-remarks-updating-canadians-canadas-plan-mobilize-industry
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-08,"Hello, everyone.
I want to begin this morning by reflecting on the reports and videos that have continued to surface in the last few days, of violence against Black Canadians and Indigenous peoples.
Our communities are suffering from inequality and racism, including in the context of the pandemic.
All you have to do is look at a map of COVID-19 cases in Toronto and Montréal to see that Black Canadians have been hit harder by the virus.
And I want to talk about what this means for our path forward as a country.
On Friday, I went to a rally on Parliament Hill to show my support and listen to what community leaders and Black Canadians are calling for.
I hear you, and I see you.
As you call out systemic discrimination, racism, and unconscious bias.
As you call for action and as you call for it now.
The reality is that many people in this country simply do not feel protected by the police.
In fact, they’re afraid of them.
That alone would be bad enough.
But systemic discrimination and racism in Canada goes much further than just policing.
It’s about poverty and mental health.
It’s about the fact that people are all too often treated like criminals instead of receiving the support that they need.
We, as governments, need to work together. 
We, as leaders, need to recognize that these problems are tied to economic inequality and the racialization of poverty.
And we need bold measures to address this.
Our government promised to address systemic racism and injustice.
We knew that this work had to be informed by the lived experiences of racialized communities and Indigenous peoples.
So we listened.
And we worked together to change things.
We invested in mental health resources and youth programs for Black Canadians.
We worked to close the gaps in services for Indigenous communities.
We funded Statistics Canada so they could create a Gender, Diversity and Inclusion Statistics hub.
And this work culminated in the release of Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy for 2019-2022, and the creation of an Anti-Racism Secretariat.
Just last fall, we appointed a Minister to focus specifically on diversity and inclusion.
Together, we have made progress.
Progress that has meant support for groups like the Black Health Alliance, and new schools for Indigenous kids.
But I hear you when you say that it isn’t enough.
I hear you when you say that it doesn’t solve systemic racism.
And I agree.
With the many disturbing reports of violence against Black Canadians and Indigenous peoples, we know that we need to do much more.
And we need to do it now.
I had a discussion with Cabinet on Friday that will continue later today.
I also spoke with Commissioner Lucki of the RCMP this morning.
The Commissioner assured me that she will use all available tools to take quick, solid action.
On our call, one of the things we discussed was the adoption of body cameras.
I’m committing to raising this with the provinces and territories this week, so we can move forward as quickly as possible. 
Minister Blair has also reaffirmed to me his commitment to improving Indigenous policing.   
And later today, I have a stocktake on reconciliation to discuss our work with Indigenous communities.
I am committing to you that this work will continue to accelerate the pace of change.
Because you deserve real commitments, as quickly as possible, that address the root causes of these problems.
Things have to change.
But repairing centuries of injustice, exclusion, and violence doesn’t happen overnight.
We have to work together and we have to work hard.
Today, I pledge to continue leading the charge.
And our government will work as hard and as quickly as possible to build a better, fairer country with you.
There’s no doubt that the last few months have been harder than anyone could have expected.
This pandemic has meant different challenges for everyone.
But, no matter who you are, and no matter what you’re dealing with, a little bit of help can make all the difference. 
Maybe your employer has been able to keep you on the payroll because of the wage subsidy, a program that’s supporting 2.5 million jobs.
Perhaps you got some extra help through the Canada Child Benefit, or you’ll receive more money with the top-up to your Old Age Security pension.
Or you might even be one of the 500,000 young people who has accessed the student benefit, helping you pay for next year’s tuition.
Over the past few months, we have worked hard to help people get through this crisis.
And the programs we created and the investments we made are making a real difference.   
I am thinking, for example, of a story Anthony Housefather told me about Franklin Empire, a company in his Montréal riding that manufactures electrical products.
This family company has been in business for four generations and employs over 500 people in Quebec and Ontario.
The business was doing well, but when the pandemic hit, it had to close its shops and its assembly lines.
It wanted to keep its employees, but could not do it alone.
And that’s where the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy came in. 
The company was able to rehire all of its employees and, with our support, pay them their full salary.
That’s 500 people and families who are receiving a paycheque like normal, despite the pandemic.
This is just one example, but it shows why programs like the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy are so important.
But we know there is still work to be done. 
On Friday, I announced that the federal government would contribute $14 billion toward a safe restart agreement with the provinces and territories, for the things that all Canadians need as we get our country back up and running.
Right now, we’re working with the premiers on what this restart could look like in the coming months.
And as we do that, we’re staying focused on people’s new realities.  
If you work in a hospital, or in a business that’s reopening, you’ll need personal protective equipment to stay safe.
If you’re back on the job, you might need transit, childcare, or the option to take time off if you’re ill.
If you’re a senior, or at higher risk from COVID-19, you may need some extra support.
These are the things that Canadians are thinking about.
So it’s what we’re thinking about, too.
The provinces and territories are all facing different realities right now and we must take them into account as we prepare the next steps.
But regardless of where you live, we are working with your premier to reach a restart agreement that will allow us to together ensure your safety and security.
In addition to working on this agreement, the premiers and I have also discussed Canadians who are separated from their loved ones because borders are closed.
We obviously want families to be together, but our priority remains the safety of Canadians.
This is an incredibly difficult time to be apart from a spouse, a child, or mom or dad.
We hear that.
That’s why we’re bringing in a limited exemption to allow immediate family members of citizens or permanent residents to come to Canada.
I want to be clear, though.
Anyone entering the country will be required to quarantine for 14 days.
And if you don’t follow these rules, you could face serious penalties.
I know that after this very difficult spring, people are hoping that the summer will be easier.
Things are starting to get better for everyone.
But we know there is still a lot of work to be done.
And Canadians can count on our support in the weeks and months to come.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on measures to support Canadians during COVID-19,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/06/08/prime-ministers-remarks-measures-support-canadians-during-covid-19
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-05,"Hello everyone.
The videos and reports that have surfaced from across the country over the past few days are disturbing.
And they bring to light the systemic realities facing far too many Canadians.
Later today, I’ll be speaking with Cabinet, and to the RCMP commissioner.
We need to ensure that each one of these individual cases is investigated properly.
But we also need a larger reflection on changing the systems that do not do right by too many Indigenous people and racialized Canadians.
We can’t solve all of this overnight.
But we need to make a change, and we need to start today.
No matter who you are, COVID-19 will have had an impact on you in one way or another.
Because everyone has been affected by this pandemic.
And as we mark National Accessibility Week, we’re reminded that some people have been hit especially hard.
Whether it’s buying PPE, or covering the cost of support workers, many Canadians with disabilities are facing unexpected bills that can be hard to pay.
To help cover these costs, today I can announce that we are introducing a one-time, non-taxable payment of $600 for Canadians with disabilities.
And we’re not stopping there.
We’re also establishing a National Workplace Accessibility Stream, to help people with disabilities find, and keep, a good job.
And we’re funding five new projects across the country that will help people get supportive devices to overcome barriers in the workplace.
I know that Minister Qualtrough will have more to say about all of this later today.
Earlier today, we received the job report for May.
The numbers show that more Canadians returned to work last month, but that many, many people continue to face a really tough time.
That tells us that we are moving forward, but we need to stay focused on getting people back on the job.
That’s why we extended the wage subsidy through the coming months – and have approved over 300,000 applications to support millions of jobs.
There’s still a long way to go, but we’re starting to see some progress.
Roughly 1.2 million Canadians who were accessing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit no longer need this help.
This is encouraging news, but we’re nowhere near done.
As I’ve said before, to really move forward we need a Canada-wide plan on safely and effectively restarting the economy.
Having the right approach, and the right resources to back it up, will determine where we are not just in the coming weeks, but into the fall and winter.
Canadians have sacrificed too much over the past couple of months to lose the progress we’ve made.
As we restart, we must do so safely with all the right precautions in place.
We know that the provinces and territories are under a lot of pressure right now, and are facing real financial challenges because of this pandemic.
And we want to help as much as possible.
We must move quickly and carefully to get this done, to support the services Canadians rely on, and to get our communities back up and running.
That’s why our government has already taken action across the board on this restart.
And now, we’re making a substantial offer to keep supporting this work.
Yesterday, at our twelfth First Ministers’ Meeting since this crisis began, I brought our government’s commitment to the table.
The federal government is ready to contribute $14 billion more for the things that all Canadians need.
As you go back to work, we want to make sure you are protected, wherever you are.
Here’s what the premiers and I will work on for a safe restart agreement, which would cover the next, critical, six to eight months.
We’re talking about more personal protective equipment for healthcare workers on the frontlines, so they can focus on saving lives instead of worrying about their safety.
We’re talking about making sure businesses have the PPE they need, so that every Canadian is safe on the job no matter where in the country they go back to work.
We’re talking about childcare, so that every parent knows there’s a safe place for their kids.
Because when moms and dads get back to work, they shouldn’t have to worry about how their kids are doing.
We all know that there are too many seniors who’ve gotten sick from COVID-19.
And along with our elders, there are many people who are especially at risk if they get the virus.
So we want to provide immediate assistance so that the most vulnerable are protected.
We’re also talking about sick pay of up to 10 days for workers who currently don’t have benefits.
The federal government would provide the funds needed to make this happen.
And we’re talking about support for cities and municipalities, so that when Canadians get back to work, they can count on the services they need like public transit and community programs.
I’m looking forward to working with the premiers to make this happen.
Provinces and territories are facing different realities, so flexibility will be important.
But here’s the bottom line:
For seniors and people who need extra support, for kids and for workers – this plan is for you.
With this safe restart agreement, we’re proposing a standard of support to keep every Canadian, right across the country, safe and healthy as we get our country back on its feet.
At this time, our main priority is helping people get through the crisis.
But we’re also thinking about what lies ahead in the coming months, years and decades.
World Environment Day reminds us that we can’t build a better future if we don’t have a plan to fight climate change.
Our government has made ambitious environmental commitments, and today, we’re following through on them.
We are announcing 60 new nature conservation initiatives across Canada.
Half of these projects will be led by Indigenous peoples. The goal isn’t just to protect our environment, but to support local economies and create good jobs for Canadians.
We are living in unprecedented times.
But this is not the first moment that Canadians have been called to work together.
This weekend, as we mark the anniversary of D-Day, we remember all those who fought and died defending the values that we hold dear.
Like the brave women and men in the Canadian Armed Forces today, our veterans served with courage and selflessness.
And they served together.
Just as we stand here this morning because of their sacrifice, Canadian troops stood on Juno Beach because of those who came before them.
Because of the Allied forces who had, this same week four years earlier, completed the rescue of over 300,000 soldiers trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk.
It was a remarkable operation.
And not just because of the number of lives that were saved, but because of the number of people who helped save them.
Hundreds of everyday men and women gave their boats to rescue their fellow citizens.
They would have never succeeded alone.
But together, they changed the course of history.
And 80 years later, as we face our own fight, their stories stand as a reminder to us all.
Right now, we each have a role to play:
As a business owner using the wage subsidy to keep your employees on the payroll.
As a young person helping your community through a Canada Summer Jobs placement.
Or even just by staying home when you can, and following physical distancing when you’re out.
No matter what you’re doing to help – thank you.
If we keep working together, if we keep supporting each other, we will get through this.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks announcing support for Canadians with disabilities,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/06/05/prime-ministers-remarks-announcing-support-canadians-disabilities
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-04,"Hello everyone.
Thank you for joining us.
Earlier today, Canada took part in a replenishment conference for GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, which was hosted by the United Kingdom.
GAVI does incredibly important work around the globe, delivering vaccines to some of the world’s most vulnerable. They’ve also been helping developing countries to respond to outbreaks like COVID-19.
GAVI saves lives, and Canada is doing its part.
Now, I want to turn to what is happening later today.
This afternoon, we’ll be releasing new modelling on COVID-19 in Canada.
We’ll have more details then, but for now I want to talk about the main takeaways for these projections.
The data shows that we are continuing to make progress in the fight against this virus.
In many communities, the number of new cases is low, and we can trace where they came from. That’s an encouraging sign that the virus is slowing, and in some places, even stopping.
But I want to be very clear: We are not out of the woods.
The pandemic is still threatening the health and safety of Canadians.
Across the country, and especially in areas where we continue to see large numbers of new cases, as well as in places like long-term care facilities and seniors’ homes, the situation remains serious.
So, while we start loosening some restrictions, we also have to strengthen other measures like testing and contact tracing.
And as people head back to work, it’s even more important that we keep a two-metre distance from others, wash our hands, and wear a mask where physical distancing is not always possible.
This is key to keeping us safe and keeping the situation under control.
Otherwise, we risk losing the progress we have made, and above all, we must continue to protect our seniors.
Even as we start to reopen parts of the economy, our parents and grandparents will have to stay home as much as possible.
The confinement is having an impact on their mental health, their personal finances, and their quality of life.
When this crisis first started, our seniors could count on a strong public pension system for steady income.
The Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, and the Guaranteed Income Supplement were our first line of defence.
But over time, this pandemic has made life more expensive.
Seniors haven’t been able to take public transit. They haven’t been able to go to a store or shop the sales because of the virus.
Instead, they’ve had to rely on deliveries to get the things they need – and it adds up. 
And what makes things even harder is the fact that this is the new normal for many of them, at least for a little while.
Even as we start to reopen parts of the economy, many seniors will have to stay home for longer to protect their health.
And that’s really weighing on them.
So, our government stepped up to help them weather this storm and help seniors with their daily expenses.
In April, more than four million low-income seniors received a GST Credit top-up—worth an average of $375 for people who are single and $510 for couples—automatically in their bank accounts.
This was a first step.
We also announced that people receiving Old Age Security would get an extra $300 to offset some of the extra costs they’ve had to cover because of the virus.
And to give even more support to low-income seniors, we said that seniors on the Guaranteed Income Supplement would get an additional $200.
That means if you are one of the 2.2 million elders receiving both OAS and GIS, you will get an additional $500 to help you with everyday expenses.
And today, I can confirm that you will be getting that money the week of July 6.
This COVID crisis is tough on seniors and that’s why these additional funds will make a difference, with up to $900 for single seniors and up to $1500 for couples.
At the same time, we are supporting programs and organizations that are helping improve seniors’ quality of life.
For example, we are investing in the New Horizons program to allow affiliated organizations to adapt their services to the realities of the pandemic and help people stay in contact with their families.
We are also providing funding to partners like the United Way, Community Foundations Canada, and the Red Cross, to combat food insecurity and provide more services to vulnerable seniors.
So while we look toward recovery, we must remember that we are not all in the same situation.
Many people, including seniors, will need to remain vigilant and follow specific instructions to protect their health.
And our government will be there to support them.
Later this evening, I will be speaking with the premiers and territorial leaders during our weekly teleconference.
We will continue the conversation we started last week on safely reopening the economy, including on the funding announced for municipalities earlier this week.
Again, thank you for being with us.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-02,"I rise today to address what so many people of colour live with every day.
Over the past few days, we’ve seen horrific reports of police violence against Black men and women south of the border.
But these are not isolated incidents or elsewhere problems.
Prejudice, discrimination, and violence is a lived reality for far too many people.
It is the result of systems which far too often condone, normalize, perpetrate, and perpetuate inequality and injustice against people of colour.
As a country, we are not concerned bystanders simply watching what is happening next door.
We are part of it.
The calls for justice, for equality, for peace, have found echo in our communities because anti-Black racism is also happening here.
Everywhere in Canada.
Every single day. 
This is something that our own staff, Cabinet ministers, and colleagues face even in these halls.
Over the past few days, I’ve heard many of these personal stories directly from them.
And I’m not just talking about acts of violence. I’m also talking about microaggressions, which many of us may not even see.
That is the daily reality of far too many racialized Canadians. And it needs to stop.
When it comes to being an ally, I have made serious mistakes in the past – mistakes which I deeply regret, and continue to learn from.
And I want to thank my colleagues, community leaders, and fellow Canadians for opening my eyes to what is really going on in our communities and helping me better understand both privilege and power.
I’m not perfect.
But not being perfect is not a free pass to not do the right thing.
It’s not an excuse to not step up.
To stand up for each other, to be an ally.
I know that for so many people listening right now, the last thing you want to hear is another speech on racism from a white politician.
I’m not here today to describe a reality I do not know or speak to a pain I have not felt. 
I’m here because I want you to know that our government is listening.
We hear your calls for justice, equality, and accountability.
We acknowledge your frustration, your anger, your heartbreak.
We see you.
Since taking office, our government has taken concrete action to fight anti-Black racism, systemic discrimination, and injustice across the country.
We have worked with communities to recognize and address injustices.
We’ve taken action to support community organizations, invest in better data, and fight racism.
For example, we have provided $9 million to support programs for young Black Canadians.
We have made significant investments to help the Public Health Agency of Canada provide more mental health services to those who have experienced racism or intergenerational trauma.
We are helping community organizations obtain funding to buy equipment or rent space.
And we have created the Anti-Racism Secretariat, which has a $4.6 million budget to eliminate systemic barriers that perpetuate injustice, notably in employment, justice, and social participation.
And while we’ve made some progress, there is still so much more to do.
Because here are the facts in Canada.
Anti-Black racism is real.
Unconscious bias is real.
Systemic discrimination is real.
For millions of Canadians, it is their daily, lived reality.
The pain and damage it causes is real, too.  
Mr. Speaker, every Canadian who has felt the weight of oppression, every student who has the courage to demand a better future, every person who marches and posts and reads and fights from Vancouver to Montréal to Halifax expects more than the status quo.
They expect more and deserve better.
The Government of Canada has a lot of work to do, but we are ready.
We are ready to work with our opposition colleagues, community leaders, and Canadians to make our country fairer and more equal.
Racism never has a place in our society.
And we will do everything we can to eradicate it from coast to coast.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
",Prime Minister’s address in the House of Commons on anti-Black racism in Canada,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/06/02/prime-ministers-address-house-commons-anti-black-racism-canada
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-02,"Hello, everyone.
Later today, I will be in the House of Commons to speak about what I know is on a lot of Canadians’ minds.
I’ll have more to say then, but for now, I want to address the role that we, as leaders and allies, have to play.
As politicians, we must listen and learn about what needs to be done to fight racism, discrimination, and injustice. 
Because being an ally is about taking a hard look at our existing systems, and being committed to doing the necessary work to fix them.
Our government is ready to take action.
Because what we’re now seeing, these are not isolated cases.
It is the result of systems that far too often tolerate, normalize and perpetuate injustice and inequality toward people of colour.
Not only across the border, but here, at home, in our communities, in our country.
It has to stop.
And those who have never faced racism or injustice have a very important role to play in all this.
It is our responsibility to acknowledge the injustices in our lives and to take concrete steps to show our solidarity with our fellow citizens.
As we move through this pandemic, I know a lot of Canadians are wondering when their community will be able to get back up and running.
The short answer is that it depends on where you live, and how things are going for your city or your region.
That’s why every province and territory has its own plan to restart.
But as I said yesterday, as a country, defeating COVID-19 is something we must do together.
Our government knows that, which is why I’ve been collaborating with the premiers on a shared approach moving forward. 
Yesterday, we took a first step, with some funding for municipalities.
Of course, help for cities and towns is just one piece of the puzzle.
We know that provinces and territories also need support on securing personal protective equipment, and other vital supplies.
And here too, we’re stepping up.
Since day one, our government has been working around the clock to secure vital PPE.
We have distributed hundreds of thousands of items to front-line workers since the beginning of the crisis.
Just take the fact that we’ve received more than 100 million surgical masks and nearly 40 million gloves, and are continuing to send a whole range of supplies to the provinces and territories.
Or that we’ve signed a contract for millions of syringes, to have the supplies needed once a vaccine is ready.
Working with suppliers from around the world is key to keeping Canadians safe.
But at the end of the day, one of the best ways to ensure we have what we need – well, it’s to make it right here at home.
Our government has been working with Canadian manufacturers to make that happen.
Over half of our face shields were produced in Canada.
Working with companies like Canadian Shield – which retooled to manufacture visors, and went from 10 employees to 200 – is a win-win.
Not only do we build our capacity to make these supplies at home, we support good jobs for Canadians.
And the same goes for testing.
We’re now funding four Canadian companies working on what may be breakthrough solutions for COVID-19 rapid testing – Deep Biologics in Guelph, Nicoya Lifesciences in Kitchener, Fourien in Edmonton, and Metabolic Insights in Kelowna.
This is on top of the support we’ve already provided for testing, including for Precision Biomonitoring as they set up a test kit manufacturing facility in Ontario. 
We’re making huge progress, but we have to keep going.
As we restart the economy, demand for supplies will go up.
And Canada must be able to keep up.
So whether it’s N95 masks or ICU equipment, we will continue our work with the provinces and territories on the supplies we need going forward.
To support Canadian jobs, to restart the economy, we have to work together.
And it’s not just as governments, but across sectors, too.
Last month, we set up the Industry Strategy Council.
Led by Minister Bains and chaired by Monique Leroux, their mandate is to take a deeper dive into the specific challenges and pressures that different industries are facing.
Today, Minister Bains announced the Council’s membership – nine business leaders from across the country who each represent a different pillar of our economy. 
This team will bring together government and industry to meet and discuss regularly, as we plan our path forward.
Since the beginning of the crisis, we have seen how important mutual help and solidarity have been.
But this doesn’t apply only to the pandemic.
There are so many challenges around the world that cannot be addressed by a single government or a single country.
Take climate change, for example. 
It is a priority for our government and we will continue to take action to protect our children’s future and the future of our planet.
We cannot do it alone.
But the good news is, we don’t have to do it alone.
For example, the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which has over 100 members around the world, is doing incredible work to improve air quality.
Earlier, the Alliance, which was founded by Canada and United Kingdom, announced its new members, including the Desjardins Group.
Desjardins will become the first North American financial institution to join the Alliance. 
Once again, Canadians are leading the way.
And our government will always be there to support initiatives like this.
I want to end this morning by recognizing that today is La Festa della Repubblica, which is the perfect time to wish everyone a happy Italian Heritage Month.
For generations, Italian-Canadians have made our country a stronger, better place.
So it comes as no surprise that during this pandemic – just like always – this community is stepping up to help.
Maybe you’ve been taking groceries over to an elderly neighbour.
Or maybe you were one of many who helped raise $1 million for the Italian Red Cross.
However you’re lending a hand: thank you.
It just goes to show that we are stronger together.
The values cherished by the Italian community—work, family, generosity—are important to all of us. 
Today and every day, we celebrate the many ways this community contributes to our country and to our lives.
Happy Italian Heritage Month.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-01,"Good morning, everyone.
I want to start by addressing the situation that’s unfolding south of the border, which is also having an impact here at home.
For far too many Canadians, the images and stories coming out of the U.S. are all too familiar.
As a country, we can’t pretend that racism doesn’t exist here.
Anti-black racism is real.
Unconscious bias is real.
And systemic discrimination is real.
And they happen here in Canada. 
Over the weekend, we saw thousands of people gather across the country to join peaceful protests against anti-black racism.
By standing together – and denouncing the few who would try to derail these demonstrations – Canadians are sending the message that they will never tolerate injustice.
To young Black Canadians:
I hear you when you say you are anxious and angry.
When you say that this brings back painful experiences of racism that you’ve faced.
I want you to know that I’m listening.
And that your government will always stand with you.
Together, we will keep taking meaningful action to fight racism and discrimination in every form.
The status quo – where people face violence because of the colour of their skin – is unacceptable.
No parent should have to once again explain to their kids that they, or their friends, might face racism. 
It is time – it is past time – for this to change.
As leaders and allies, we must do the hard work needed to listen and learn.
We must ensure that everyone is safe and respected.
That includes journalists, who need to be able to do their work on the frontlines to expose the truth and tell the stories we need to hear.  
And we must, as Canadians, always keep working together, to build a fairer, better, more equitable country for all.  
It has been a very difficult spring for many people.
And although the path forward won’t be easy, things will get better.
Over the last month, we’ve started to see promising signs that the curve is flattening in Canada.
Now, the situation remains very serious, but the more we can control the spread of the virus, the more we can begin restarting. 
In many parts of the country, this is already happening.
In others, where the situation remains more uncertain, steps are being taken more slowly.
Every province and territory will have its own approach.
But as we move forward with restarting the economy, we must keep working together.
On Thursday, as part of our weekly call, I spoke to the premiers about collaboration on the path ahead.
I’m working closely with them – just like with mayors and other leaders – on what this approach should include.
Because there are a whole range of issues that will require us to take action together.
As I’ve said before, to keep Canadians safe, to give businesses the confidence to reopen their doors and people the confidence to walk through those doors, we need to cooperate on country-wide testing and contact tracing.
And on this front, we’re making good progress.
At the same time, our government is ready to be a partner for the provinces and territories in supporting vulnerable people, securing personal protective equipment, and working on childcare, to name a few.
In other words, we’re ready to be a partner in a safe, effective restart of the economy.
And today, we’re demonstrating a first step forward, with support for municipalities as they face a cash crunch.
From testing clinics to programs for seniors, cities and towns provide essential services.
So it’s crucial that they have the resources they need.
In response to COVID-19, we will make available $2.2 billion for municipalities in the coming weeks, through their yearly federal support with the Gas Tax Fund.
Normally, municipalities receive these payments in two instalments, but we know that cities and towns need this money right away as they deal with COVID-19.
That’s why we’re making the full 2020/2021 payment available now.
Minister McKenna has sent letters to all of her provincial and territorial counterparts to outline how this accelerated process will work.
But here’s the bottom line:
This is strong support to keep Canadians safe and our communities strong.
And it’s support that will give businesses the confidence to reopen, getting hardworking Canadians back on the job.
This is a start.
We know there’s more to be done to support municipalities and to support the entire reopening process.
There is still a lot to do to get our communities up and running again, to get our businesses open again, and to get people back to work.
In the days and weeks to come, we’ll keep working with the provinces and territories on this, and on a whole range of other measures.
But I know that we can do it, together.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-29,"Hello, everyone.
From day one, our government has been working with the provinces and territories to keep Canadians safe and address this pandemic.
And this morning, I want to begin with an update on where this work stands. 
Yesterday, the premiers and I, along with Deputy Prime Minister Freeland, had our eleventh First Ministers’ Meeting since this crisis began.
We discussed the very concerning reports regarding certain long-term care homes in Ontario and Quebec.
What the Canadian Armed Forces reported is deeply disturbing.
That any senior would face this kind of treatment is unacceptable.
And as I said to the premiers, our government will be there to support them, as we work together to ensure that our elders receive the care they deserve. 
In our meeting, we also talked about what we need to do, together, to help businesses reopen and get people back on the job, while keeping our communities safe.
Moving forward, it will become even more important to quickly identify, and then isolate, this virus.
To do that effectively, we need to coordinate across the country.
A number of provinces have already reached out to us for support on contact tracing, and our governments are currently working together on a data-sharing platform.
And yesterday, First Ministers were briefed on the work being done by the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, which will coordinate blood test surveys across Canada.
The premiers and I also spoke about support for workers during this difficult time.
Our government will continue discussions with the provinces on ensuring that as we enter the recovery phase, every worker in Canada has 10 days of paid sick leave a year.
Because no one should have to choose between taking a day off sick, and paying their bills.
Our government is also working with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation leaders to support communities during the crisis.
We have already made a number of investments to help provide loans to Indigenous businesses, student jobs, and services to those who live off reserve.
But we know there is still work to be done.
And today, we are taking another step. 
This morning, I can announce that we are investing $650 million to support Indigenous communities on health care, income support, and new shelters for women.
Let me start with the first pillar, which is health care.
Although we’ve made progress, there are still communities that are not properly equipped to handle a COVID-19 outbreak.
And we need to address that.
That’s why we are investing over $285 million for public health in First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities.
These funds will go toward more nurses, will help procure specialized supplies, and will support work with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities on continued, community-driven responses.
Having the right health care is essential, but it isn’t the only concern facing communities right now.
Because of this pandemic, a lot of people also need a hand in paying for the basics.
So, as the second pillar of this investment, we are boosting the On-Reserve Income Assistance Program.
This money will support people living on reserve who need help paying for things like groceries, cleaning supplies, or rent.
A portion of this funding will also help First Nations communities continue to provide services like skills training, and support for people as they navigate federal benefits.
The work being done in communities—by members of the communities—is incredibly important to help people get through this very challenging time.
And that brings me to the third pillar of this funding—investment in shelters.
In April, we announced $10 million so that emergency shelters for Indigenous women and children could adapt to the new challenges posed by COVID-19.
This is vital support in the short-term.
But in the long-term, more still needs to be done.
So today, I can announce that our government is investing an additional $85 million for new shelters for Indigenous women.
These shelters will be built in communities across the country, including in the North.
No one should have to stay in a place where they’re unsafe.
No one should be forced to choose between violence or homelessness.
These new shelters will offer a path forward when people need it most.
I want to end today with an update on another measure we’ve taken to keep Canadians safe.
Earlier this morning, Minister Garneau announced that large cruise ships will not be allowed in Canadian waters until at least October 31.
This decision extends the one we made in March, which was taken to protect our coastal communities.
COVID-19 is still a very serious threat.
But with the right plan, and with the right investments, we will weather this storm together.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-28,"Hello everyone. Welcome.
Thank you all for joining us.
And thank you to my co-hosts, Secretary-General Guterres and Prime Minister Holness.
We have organizations like the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD, the private sector, and over 50 countries represented here today.
We wanted to bring this diverse group together because to address the current crisis, we need to think outside the box.
I don’t need to tell you that over the past few months, far too many people have died and far too many communities have been shattered because of the global pandemic.
COVID-19 is a health crisis, but on a global scale, it has prompted an economic and social crisis as well.  
And that’s why we are here, at the United Nations.
This is truly a global challenge, with many dimensions.
As Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados has so eloquently put it, this virus transcends borders, threatening lives and livelihoods everywhere.
We have all been affected by the pandemic, but some countries have been hit harder than others.
The pandemic is testing our social, economic, and political resilience.
And those who are most vulnerable in our societies—including seniors, refugees, small business owners, and young people—are suffering the worst consequences.
The magnitude of these economic and social shocks could plunge tens of millions of people into extreme poverty and threaten hard-won development gains in a number of countries.
The situation will likely be especially catastrophic for women and girls living in fragile and conflict-affected countries, which could intensify the difficulties they will face when the recovery stage begins.
We cannot let this happen.
This pandemic is a stark reminder of just how interconnected our world has become.
To keep our citizens safe and healthy, we must defeat COVID-19 wherever it is found.
And for the global economy to recover, and for our domestic economies to bounce back, we need a global, coordinated plan.
Our citizens need to have confidence in international institutions that leave no one behind and are capable of overcoming global challenges.
We know that jobs and businesses in each of our countries depend on the health and stability of economies everywhere.
It matters to all of us how this global economy weathers this storm.
Our success – both at home and together as an international community – hinges on it.
Slowing the spread of the virus, protecting our citizens, and preparing for recovery is an unprecedented—and very expensive—challenge, even for countries like Canada.
So we cannot expect small countries, which have neither the same resources nor the same infrastructure as ours, and are facing much more serious consequences than we are, to be able to beat the virus on their own.
We need to recognize the specific challenges that developing countries in Africa and small island states are facing.
We must implement a comprehensive and sustainable international response.
And that’s what has brought us together here today.
We’re bringing together not only world leaders, but also key experts from various fields who can help us better understand and address economic implications of this pandemic.
This is our chance to begin a conversation on how we can emerge from this truly global crisis as a stronger and more cohesive world – one that creates growth for everyone, addresses inequality, and cares for the most vulnerable.
Over the coming months, we will all be working together in different work streams to bring forward ambitious but pragmatic solutions.
Canada is ready to do our part as we help bring the world together in the fight against COVID-19.
COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge for our modern world, but it’s also a unique opportunity to build a better future, to create a safe and prosperous world, and an international system that recognizes who’s left behind and strives to lift them up.
Once again, thank you all for joining us in this important discussion.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-27,"Hello everyone.
Over the past few weeks, members of the Canadian Armed Forces have been helping out in long-term care facilities and seniors’ residences in Quebec and Ontario.
Ontario and Quebec have asked us to extend the Army’s mission and, as I said yesterday, our government is currently discussing it with them.
Our members are doing an extraordinary job helping our grandparents, parents, and seniors during this crisis, and I thank them very much.
It is certainly not an easy job or an easy situation.
This morning, the Government of Quebec released the Canadian Forces members’ report outlining a number of concerning issues.
Several of the issues in the report—like the lack of staff—were among the reasons why Premier Legault requested the Army’s assistance a month and a half ago.
There are serious concerns that had to be brought to Quebec’s attention and we sent the province the report last night.
I also spoke with Premier Legault earlier this morning and I reiterated our support.
Tomorrow, I plan on raising what’s happening in nursing homes and long-term care facilities with the premiers during our weekly call.
I will once again offer our government’s support as they try to get the situation under control.
As I’ve said many times, we need to do a better job of caring for seniors.
They raised us. They built this country. They deserve better.
During the first few weeks of the crisis, people’s lives were turned upside down.
Hundreds of thousands of Canadians lost their job through no fault of their own—without warning—because of this pandemic.
It put enormous financial pressure on everyone, from students to young professionals to families.
And to help as many Canadians as possible keep their jobs or get hired, we introduced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
We also unveiled our $9-billion plan to help students and recent grads get through the next few months.
We now have over 45,000 jobs available for young people. If you or someone you know is interested, go to jobbank.gc.ca to apply.
Now, as provinces and territories restart some activities and many people head back to work, fewer people will need the help of the CERB.
But the wage subsidy will continue to be there to support Canadians, and make sure they can get paid their salaries.
Maintaining the connection between employer and employee is key not just to helping people get back on their feet, but to keeping our economy strong.
That’s why it’s so important that employers take advantage of this program and rehire workers.
If you are an employer or a business owner but have not yet applied, I encourage you to visit the Canada Revenue Agency website to do so. 
As I have said since the beginning, to get through this crisis, everyone has to do their part.
To save lives, people have to continue practising physical distancing.
To restart the economy, people need to work, and merchants and businesses need to have customers.
So, if you’re an employer, rehire your employees.
Our government can and will help you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-26,"Hello, everyone.  
Over the last few weeks, our women and men in uniform have been working to help the most vulnerable Canadians as we deal with this pandemic.
And as the need for their help continues, we have received new requests to extend this period of deployment in both Ontario and Quebec, and we will be following up.
Members of the Canadian Armed Forces are doing an incredible job, just like always.
They are serving with distinction for our grandparents, our parents, our elders.
In Ontario, they’ve made some extremely troubling observations about several long-term care facilities in which they’ve been serving, and we’ve shared this information with the provincial government.
As I’ve said many times, we need to do a better job of caring for the people who built this country.
The Greatest Generation saw us through the Second World War
We need to be there to support them properly through this global crisis.
I spoke with Premier Ford on this earlier this morning, to let him know that, of course, we would be there to help as he takes action on improving care for seniors in long-term care centres.
Our government will continue to support Ontarians through this.
And I know this is something the Premier will be addressing in greater detail at his press conference later today.
This morning, I also want to provide an update on personal protective equipment.
In the last 10 weeks alone, over 40 flights have arrived in Canada carrying much-needed PPE.
This represents hundreds of thousands of items – everything from masks to hospital gowns – that we’ve shipped to our front-line workers.
At the same time, we’re also investing in production here at home.
And on that front, today, we’re taking yet another critical step forward.
I can announce that we have signed a contract with General Motors to produce 10 million face masks.
As we speak, GM employees are already making these masks, and the first shipments of masks will be ready soon.
They will keep people safe and help slow the spread of COVID-19.
And for the autoworkers in Oshawa, this contract will support good, well-paying jobs in an industry that’s faced tough times.
On testing, we’re also making progress.
We’re supporting companies and research centres across the country as they develop new, improved COVID-19 test kits and products.
And for life-saving health care equipment, we’ve signed a new contract for 10,000 ventilators that are being produced through a partnership between Canadian Nobel Laureate Dr. Art McDonald, his team, and Vexos.
Deliveries will begin this summer, bringing our total of made-in-Canada ventilators to 40,000.
On this, and on other supplies for front-line workers, I know that Minister Bains and Minister Anand will have more details to share a little later today.
Over the past two months, we’ve rolled out targeted support for sectors that have been hit hard by COVID-19.
And we know that more needs to be done.
Just look at the food industry.
With the growing season underway, farmers are working harder than ever to keep Canadians fed.
But because of COVID-19, many are having trouble finding workers.  
So today, I can announce that our government is funding up to 700 youth jobs in that industry.
This will support the people who put food on our plates, while creating new opportunities for young people.
This builds on what we’ve already done, from connecting more Canadians of every age with work in the sector, to supporting seasonal workers.
In the last weeks, Canadians have been focused on our families and on our neighbours, on our communities and our country.
But we’ve also been closely engaged with how the world is managing COVID-19.
Not only because the only way to truly end this virus in Canada is to end it everywhere, but because as a trading nation, with Canadians who trace their origins to every corner of the planet, we understand better than most how connected the world has become.
Canadian jobs and businesses depend on stable and productive economies in other countries – so it matters to us how everyone weathers this storm.
We cannot forget those who are most vulnerable, whether they are living in remote regions or in the Caribbean.
For so many, this pandemic is devastating.
More than 300 million people around the world will be out of work.
And more than 30 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty.
We can’t wait for others to act.
It’s not in our self-interest, and it’s just not who we are. 
We can – and we must – seize the opportunity to do what we can to make people safer and more prosperous.
To create an international system that recognizes who is left behind and strives to lift them up. 
This is no small task.
But I know we’re up to it.
Canada is ready to do our part, as we help bring the world together in the fight against COVID-19. 
On Thursday, I will be convening a high-level meeting with the Secretary-General of the UN and the Prime Minister of Jamaica, to consider global economic challenges and how to better support developing countries.
We’re bringing together leaders from every region of the world, as well as the heads of international institutions, to work on shared strategies to protect the global economy, support our citizens, and help the most vulnerable.
I have been speaking to many leaders about these issues, about the importance of global cooperation.
This includes Chancellor Merkel of Germany and President Macron of France just yesterday, and leaders from the Caribbean and from across Africa, Latin America, and the Pacific.
And key international financial experts – like Canada’s own Mark Carney – are getting involved, too.
To address this pandemic, to keep people safe, to help our economies weather the storm, we need to collaborate.
And with this forum, Canada will be there to help lead the way forward.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-25,"Hello, everyone.
As a country, we‘re making progress in the fight against COVID-19.
But we have to remember that the situation remains very serious.
We’re not out of the woods yet.
As we move into the summer, we’ll have to keep adjusting our routines.
Our cities will have to adjust and change.
And our approach will have to be tailored to each community.
That means the rules and public health recommendations you’re asked to follow may be different depending on where you live.
And that can be confusing.
But, right across the country, one thing stays the same: everyone has a responsibility to themselves and to the people around them.
So, keep practising physical distancing.
This is how we protect ourselves, protect our loved ones, and protect the most vulnerable. 
Moving forward with reopening must happen gradually and carefully.
And the right safeguards must be in place, including testing and contact tracing.
This is key to keeping us safe and keeping the situation under control.
What reopening means for you and for your family will be different for everyone.
Just take the realities facing small business owners.
Some are ready to open their doors as soon as they get the green light that it’s safe to do so.
But for many more, getting back on their feet will be a challenge.
And one of the biggest concerns is paying rent.
That’s why we created the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program.
This benefit will provide forgivable loans to landlords, so that they can lower rent by 75 per cent for small businesses hit hardest by COVID-19.
It will also be available to non-profit and charitable organizations.
As of 8:00 a.m. this morning, applications have now opened.
If you’re a landlord with up to 10 eligible tenants, and you’re located in the Atlantic, B.C., Alberta, or Quebec, you can apply today at cmhc.ca.
For landlords in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and the Territories who have up to 10 eligible tenants, tomorrow’s your day to apply.
Landlords with more than 10 tenants will be able to apply later this week.
To landlords: please apply.
And to business owners: make sure you’re holding up your end of the bargain as well.
Whether it’s this rent support or the wage subsidy, we have put several programs in place to help businesses and we will continue to work on other ways to support them.
The Canada Emergency Business Account can help you pay your rent on time.
And the wage subsidy, which we’re extending through the summer, can help you rehire your workers.
We’re all in this together. And together is how we’re going to get through it.
Today, I want to announce that we are launching a phone line with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce to help you navigate these uncertain times.
Vulnerable small businesses and entrepreneurs, including charities and non-profit organizations, will be able to get help from an accountant or a financial advisor by calling the Business Resilience Service at 1‑866‑989-1080.
This initiative is especially for those organizations that may not have access to financial advice.
And to take the pressure off during tax season, we are also extending the deadline for certain income tax returns.
For those who have to file a T2 Corporate Income Tax Return or a T3 Trust Income Tax Return in June, July, or August, you will now have until September 1 to file.
Every day, in every part of the country, hardworking Canadians build prosperity and growth in their communities.
To come out of this crisis, our country needs workers – people like you – more than ever.
Our government knows that.
And we know that you deserve to be treated fairly on the job.  
This is something that I spoke with the leader of the NDP, Jagmeet Singh, about yesterday.
Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills.
Just like nobody should have to choose between staying home with COVID-19 symptoms or being able to afford rent or groceries.
That’s why the government will continue discussions with the provinces, without delay, on ensuring that as we enter the recovery phase of the pandemic, every worker in Canada who needs it has access to 10 days of paid sick leave a year.
And we’ll also consider other mechanisms for the longer term, to support workers with sick leave.
Later today, I will be back in Parliament as we continue moving forward with our plan to get Canadians the support they need.
Whether you’re an employer or an employee, we’re working to make sure you can focus on what matters most: getting back to work safely, adapting to new realities, and keeping yourself and others safe.
You will drive our recovery.
And as you do, we’ll be in your corner, every step of the way.
Thank you very much.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-22,"Hello everyone.
This morning, we awoke to terrible news coming out of Pakistan.
A Pakistan International Airlines plane carrying over a hundred passengers crashed in a residential neighbourhood in Karachi.
My heart goes out to all the victims and their families.
Our thoughts are with Pakistan today.
We’re starting a bit earlier this morning because we have a Cabinet meeting early this afternoon, so thank you all for joining us now.
Last night, the premiers and I held our tenth weekly call since the beginning of the crisis.
And we talked about what’s been on everyone’s mind lately: how we can safely reopen the economy.
Over the past few months, Canadians have been doing a great job of staying at home, maintaining physical distancing, and listening to public health advice.
And that means that we can restart some activities.
But we’re not out of the woods yet.
COVID-19 remains a serious health threat.
We have to proceed with caution and keep listening to science, or we risk losing the progress we’ve made.
So today, I want to outline what we know needs to happen to successfully reopen the economy and adjust to our new normal.
First, we need to continue scaling up our testing capacity, so we can quickly identify new cases and isolate them.
We’re working with provinces and territories to expand testing by procuring things like reagents and swabs.
While some provinces have the capacity to meet their current needs, we’re collaborating to ramp up testing, so we can protect Canadians and effectively manage future outbreaks.
Second, we need to accelerate our ability to do contact tracing.
After we’ve confirmed and isolated new cases, we have to get in touch with everyone who may have been exposed to the virus, and make sure they take measures to quarantine and monitor themselves for symptoms or get tested.
While provinces and territories are managing testing and contact tracing differently, our government has trained federal employees who can make 3,600 contact tracing calls a day, seven days a week.
Statistics Canada also has an additional 1,700 interviewers ready to go, who can make up to 20,000 calls a day.
These federal resources are available to assist provinces and territories with any surges or backlogs or challenges they have in contact tracing.
We’re already helping to make calls in Ontario and stand ready to help anywhere else.
Third, we have to ensure that data collected across jurisdictions is shared between provinces and territories.
This will help us track the spread of the virus, adapt our response accordingly, and save lives.
Now, Canada is a vast country and some regions have been hit harder than others by the pandemic.
That’s why plans to relax restrictions vary from one jurisdiction to another.
But in order for people to move around freely, and start getting back to normal life, we have to improve our ability to quickly pinpoint the virus and isolate it.
All premiers recognize how important this is and I want to thank them for their engagement in this issue.
Since the beginning of this crisis, all jurisdictions have been working toward one common goal: protecting Canadians.
The next phase of our collaborative efforts is on testing, contact tracing, and data collection, and I have told the premiers that the federal government is here to support, facilitate, and fund this important work.
Taking strong, collaborative action to expand testing and contact tracing is important for both Canadians and businesses to have confidence that we’re on the right foot.
They need to know that we have a coordinated approach to gradually reopen that is rooted in science, evidence, and the ability to rapidly detect and control any future outbreaks.
Over the past few months, we’ve set up a number of programs to help everyone – from students to parents to seniors – get through this crisis.
If you need support, but you’re not quite sure where to start, we now have a new online tool to help you.
Just go to canada.ca/coronavirusbenefits. You’ll find a list of a few simple questions, and the tool will generate an array of programs for which you may be eligible.
I want to close today by addressing the significant increase in acts of racism against Asian Canadians.
Over the past few weeks and months, businesses, buildings, and statues have been vandalized.
People have been verbally abused and physically attacked.
It’s unacceptable.
Hate, violence, and discrimination have no place in Canada.
This is not who we are as Canadians.
I want to thank those who have stood up against violence, and exposed what is happening in our communities.
We need to speak out against racism wherever it is found, so we can stop it.
To Asian Canadians across the country, know that we all stand with you.
We will not let hate divide us.
Thank you, everyone.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-21,"Morning everyone.
The first thing I want to talk about today is what we’re doing to support Indigenous people during the pandemic.
Since day one, our government has been engaging with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation leaders in the fight against this virus.
We’ve been listening to people’s concerns and working with local leadership to ensure that communities are getting the right support.
And so far, we’ve taken a number of important steps.
We’re investing in emergency shelters to help Indigenous women and children fleeing violence.
We’re offering interest-free loans and non-repayable contributions to help Indigenous businesses weather this storm.
We’re helping First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation students and recent grads find a job this summer.
And last week, we announced more funding to support the most urgent needs of Indigenous communities dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak.
While all communities have had to wrestle with COVID-19 these past few months, the everyday realities of this crisis are different for everyone.
To mount an effective response to this crisis, we must adapt our approach and our programs to recognize and meet the particular needs of all Indigenous peoples, including those living in urban areas and off reserve.
To this end, we announced $15 million back in March to support Indigenous organizations that deliver services to these populations as part of the Indigenous Community Support Fund we had set up to help prevent and mitigate the impact of this virus.
With this money, organizations have been able to give meals, groceries, clothing, and supplies to those in need, prevent domestic violence, and offer mental health counselling.
They’ve also provided personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies for supportive housing, and computers and laptops so kids can keep up with their schoolwork.
This funding is helping vulnerable people like youth, women, and elders.
Indigenous community organizations in our cities and off reserve do crucial work year-round, but these days, their services are in high demand because of the pandemic.
We need to make sure they have the resources to adapt and grow their services, so they can fulfill their important mission.
So today, our government is announcing an additional $75 million in new funding for organizations that address the critical needs of the over one million Indigenous people living in urban centres and off reserve.
This is critical work.
If you live off reserve or in a city, we’re working to make sure you don’t fall through the cracks.
You need and deserve services that are culturally appropriate.
And that’s what we’re doing with today’s investment.
I would now like to address employers and business owners.
There is a lot of talk these days about reopening the economy, which is good news for everyone.
But if you had to slow down or stop operations over the past few months, opening up again will also present a number of challenges.
So we are putting measures in place to support you.
If you need help rehiring your employees, you can use the Canada Emergency Wage subsidy. We have just extended the program until the end of the summer.
If you are having cash flow problems or if you have expenses to pay, you can apply for a loan through the Canada Emergency Business Account.
And if you are not eligible for either of these programs, I encourage you to contact your regional development agency. It will be able to help.
We are also working with the provinces, the territories, property owners, and their tenants to reduce small businesses’ rent.
Property owners can apply on the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s website as of Monday.
We are all anxious for life to get back to normal. But for that to happen, everyone has to do their part, and employers especially have an important role to play.
When people think of things getting back to normal, one of the first things they think of is getting back to work.
Regaining some financial stability. Seeing their friends and colleagues again. Getting back into a routine.
Your employees are counting on you. And so is your community.
So, if you need help, but you don’t know where to start—visit the COVID-19 page at Canada.ca.
There, you will find information on all the programs available to you and how to get some help.
Our government is here for you.
We’re already getting ready to restart the economy, and I know that, together, we will come back strong at the end of this crisis.
As we gradually and carefully restart some activities, it’s never been more important to follow public health instructions.
COVID-19 remains a very serious health threat.
Yesterday, Dr. Tam said that whenever physical distancing is not possible, Canadians should wear a non-medical mask or face covering when they go out.
I want to remind everyone that physical distancing means keeping a two-metre distance with others.
As we start to reopen the economy, it might be more difficult to maintain that distance at all times, so please follow Dr. Tam’s advice.
Keep washing your hands, stay home, and if you need to, wear a mask.
This is the best way to protect both yourself and others.
I want to end today with a piece of good news.
Today, more than 230 new officers are graduating from the Royal Military College of Canada.
They are part of a new generation of exceptional women and men ready to serve our country with distinction.
You have chosen to step up and serve your country and we could not be more proud of you.
Thank you for your example.
Thank you for your dedication.
Thank you for your love of this extraordinary country.
And mostly, thank you for everything you will do for us in the coming years.
Congratulations to the class of 2020.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on additional support for Indigenous peoples,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/21/prime-ministers-remarks-additional-support-indigenous-peoples
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-20,"Hello, everyone.
Over the last two months, Canadians have stepped up to keep each other safe.
And because of those actions and those choices, in many parts of the country, we’re getting this virus under control.
Now, that doesn’t mean we can let down our guard.
But what our progress does mean is that where it’s safe to do so, we can gradually and carefully restart some of our activities.
For many small business owners and their workers, being able to reopen is welcome news.
Of course, this is not without its challenges. People need help getting back on their feet.
That’s why we brought in new, targeted support to get businesses going again.   
Use the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to rehire your workers.
And contact your Regional Development Agency, where we’ve boosted funding, if you don’t qualify for other supports.
Thousands of business owners have already navigated the process and are getting the help they need.
And if you’re not one of them yet, we’re making it simpler to find out what’s available.
Go to the COVID-19 page at canada.ca.
You’ll find a section that lays out all the programs based on what your need is, from rehiring staff to accessing credit.
Your business matters—to your employees and to our country.
In fact, it matters to our whole economy.
So, a concern for you, is a concern for us too.
And that brings me to the question of your rent.
Paying rent on your space might be a problem right now.
We hear that, so we’re taking action.
We’ve created the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance for small businesses program.
This benefit will provide forgivable loans to landlords, so that they can reduce by 75 per cent the rent of small business tenants that have lost the majority of their revenues because of COVID-19.
If you’re a landlord, and you and your tenant are eligible, please apply.
Go to cmhc.ca to get the details on what information you’ll need when the application portal opens starting May 25.
Once this launches, you’ll receive your relief quickly.
Our government, along with the provinces and territories, will cover 50 per cent of the rent.
We’re asking that landlords absorb 25 per cent, and tenants pay the rest with the support of programs like the CEBA.
For larger retailers, we’re also working on a new support, and we’ll have more details to share soon.
These are challenging times.
But together, we can protect jobs and make sure that our economy bounces back.
And that will be good for everyone. 
Whether you work at the restaurant around the corner or at an office downtown, your job is how you support yourself and your family.
And no matter what you do, no matter how many other people your workplace employs, we need to protect that.
In addition to our support for small businesses, we’ve also brought in help for companies of every size.
Last week, we launched the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility to provide bridge loans for the country’s largest employers.
As of today, applications for this financing are open.
These loans will be delivered through the Canada Development Investment Corporation, in cooperation with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, and the Department of Finance.
Our priority is that this program be fair and effective.
Loans will be designed with a clear goal: protecting jobs and helping our economy rebound.
Businesses can go online to cdev.gc.ca for more information on the application process.
But I want to be clear.
We are not offering companies a bailout.
We are making loans available so that they can weather this storm and continue to employ millions of hardworking Canadians.
No matter who you are or where you live, we’re here to support you.
So, I want to end this morning by reminding parents that when you receive your Canada Child Benefit payment today, it will include an extra $300 per child.
This is money to help you through this very tough time.
So I want to say this to parents.
It’s really hard to raise kids these days.
But you are doing an excellent job, despite all the challenges, all the problems we are facing together as a society. Parents are doing an extraordinary job every day.
Keep it up.
We’ll be here for you.
And we will get through this, together.
Thank you.  
",Prime Minister’s remarks on help available for business owners affected by COVID-19,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/20/prime-ministers-remarks-help-available-business-owners-affected-covid-19
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-19,"Hello, everyone.
Let me begin this morning by confirming that Canada and the United States have once again agreed to extend by 30 days the current measures in place along the border.
This is an important decision that will keep people in both of our countries safe.
I also want to address the tragic Royal Canadian Air Force plane crash in Kamloops over the weekend.
My thoughts, and the thoughts of all Canadians, are with the families of Captain Casey, Captain MacDougall, and the entire Snowbirds team.
This has been a very difficult few weeks for members of the Canadian Armed Forces.
As we mourn, we remember Captain Casey as a proud Nova Scotian and an outstanding servicewoman.
A journalist who turned her talents to the Forces, she will be remembered not just for her professionalism, but for her sense of humour and for her kindness.
As we honour her, we pay tribute to the bravery of all those who serve today.
Our women and men in uniform are always there for us.
Serving overseas, to defend the values we hold dear. Working here at home to care for our seniors, and lift our spirits with flyovers. So, to everyone who so proudly wears the maple leaf—thank you. You do your country proud today and every day.
As we start to carefully and gradually re-open our economy, a lot of people will be wondering what that means for them.
If you’ve been laid off, you’re probably waiting to see whether your employer will start up your workplace and rehire you.
To help them do that, we’ve extended the wage subsidy through the summer.
This is about getting people back to work, and giving businesses the confidence to re-open, rehire, and even grow.
Because the way our economy will recover, and the way our country will remain resilient and successful, is by getting Canadians back to work.
Many business owners are already benefiting from this program, to rehire and maintain the crucial link between workplace and employee.
To employers looking to start up again: please, rehire your workers.
Use the wage subsidy for their paycheque.
That’s what it’s there for.
And for businesses that still need help, today we’re taking another step forward. 
Over 600,000 small businesses have already received a $40,000 loan through the program.
But we know that there are still more people who need help.
If you are the sole owner-operator of a business, if your business relies on contractors, or if you have a family-owned business and you pay employees through dividends, you will now qualify.
For example, for a hair salon owner with stylists who rent chairs, for a local physiotherapist, for an independent gym owner with contracted trainers—this is for you.
We’ll have more details very soon about when you’ll be able to apply.
We heard you when you said you needed a hand.
We are working hard to ensure that people keep their jobs or can return to work, and we are doing so by helping small businesses, which are so important to our communities, to maintain operations.
That’s why Minister Ng is also working on potential solutions to help business owners and entrepreneurs who operate through their personal bank account, as opposed to a business account, or have yet to file a tax return, such as newly created businesses.
And, as we announced last week, there’s new funding for Regional Development Agencies too, which you can always contact if you still don’t meet these expanded criteria.  
Businesses like yours are the backbone of our economy and the lifeblood of our communities.
Because that’s how Canada will be able to come back strong.
And whether it’s with the CEBA or the expanded wage subsidy—we’re in your corner.
Of course, in order to get through this crisis, we also need enough medical equipment and personal protective equipment to keep people healthy and safe. 
So this morning, I would like to give you an update on personal protective equipment.
Over the past few weeks alone, we have doubled our inventory of surgical masks and face shields.
This week, and in the weeks to come, hundreds of thousands of hospital gowns, glasses, face shields, and swabs will be delivered to the provinces and territories.
We have also received an order of ZOLL ventilators from the United States.
And because we want to use Canadian-made equipment as much as possible, we are also increasing our production capacity. 
We now have 15 contracts across the country to manufacture hospital gowns.
We will also start receiving gowns from Montréal-based Samuelsohn by the end of the month.
I want to end this morning with some good news, something we haven’t had enough of lately.
As of today, Canada now has its first university in the North.
Yukon College is becoming the new Yukon University.
And as a cornerstone for this step, our government has already provided $26 million for a new science building.
To everyone who helped make this milestone happen—congratulations.
Not just for students, but for all of us, this is truly something to celebrate.
Young people have the power to change our country for the better.
And it’s up to us to make sure that no matter where they live, they have the tools to chase their dreams and succeed.
Today, more than ever, we need their vision and their creativity.
Because that is our path forward.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on the expansion of support for workers and businesses,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/19/prime-ministers-remarks-expansion-support-workers-and-businesses
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-16,"Hello everyone. Happy weekend.
I want to start by noting that tomorrow is the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia.
Every year, this is a day where we speak out against the stigma, discrimination, and violence that target the LGBTQ2 community.
We need to show our solidary tomorrow, and every day.
Homophobia, transphobia and biphobia are never ok.
We all have a role to play in building a Canada where everyone can be proud of who they are and whom they love.
No matter where you live or what you do in life, your life has changed as a result of the pandemic.
Your needs, worries and challenges are not the same as before because the situation is no longer the same.
Our government has put in place new programs to help you get through the crisis – whether you are studying, retired, employed or not.
At the same time, there will be more support for programs and organizations whose work is even more essential these days.
I want to start with some news on the medical front.
Health Canada has now approved the first Canadian clinical trials for a potential COVID-19 vaccine at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University.
The National Research Council of Canada will be working with the manufacturer so that if these vaccine trials are successful, we can produce and distribute it here at home.
Research and development take time, and must be done right, but this is encouraging news.
A few weeks ago, we announced $40 million for women’s shelters and sexual assault centres across the country.
And for Indigenous women and children fleeing violence, we’re providing $10 million for emergency shelters.
Our goal was to help these organizations take all the necessary steps to protect people not only from violence, but from COVID-19.
To date, more than 500 women’s shelters and sexual assault organizations have received additional support, including Inasmuch House in Hamilton, the Miramichi Emergency Centre for Women, the Saskatoon Interval House, and the South Okanagan Women in Need Society.
Community organizations such as women’s shelters are an essential resource for the most vulnerable people.
And their mission has not changed during the pandemic.
In fact, they serve a growing clientele and must adapt to the realities and challenges of the pandemic.
We have therefore launched the Emergency Community Support Fund with a budget of $350 million.
Most of the funds will be distributed through United Way Centraide, the Community Foundations of Canada and the Red Cross.
Eligibility criteria and details about the application process will be posted on our partners’ websites, and the good news is that organizations in need of support will be able to apply starting on Tuesday.
I now want to turn to what we’re doing for parents.
As you’ve probably heard, we’re boosting the Canada Child Benefit for the month of May.
You can expect to receive $300 more per child when you get your benefit this Wednesday, but that’s not all.
Starting on July 20, we will increase the Canada Child Benefit once again for the upcoming year.
Every summer for the past three years, we boosted the CCB to help keep up with the cost of living – and this summer will be no different.
As the price of your groceries go up, so will the benefit.
Targeted support measures are planned for parents, as well as students and seniors, because we recognize that these groups face particular challenges as a result of the pandemic.
However, it is clear that there are other people who still need help.
I am referring, in particular, to women business owners who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic.
Many operate smaller businesses and have liquidity problems. Others operate in sectors that are crippled by COVID-19 such as hotels, restaurants and retail sales.
The issues related to the pandemic are in addition to the barriers that businesswomen unfortunately still face, such as gender discrimination.
To better support women during the crisis, our government will inject $15 million into the Women Entrepreneurship Strategy.
From the outset, our number one priority has always been to protect the health and safety of Canadians.
And we’ve been able to count on the Canadian Red Cross to do just that.
They’ve been playing a key role in supporting Canadians during this crisis, helping both individuals and communities with their most pressing needs.
But like many organizations, the Red Cross is facing an increased demand for its services at a time where they’re getting fewer volunteers and receiving less in donations.
So today, our government is investing up to $100 million to ensure that the Red Cross can keep responding to COVID-19, while also preparing for potential floods and wildfires.
This morning, I would like to close with a few words to the children and young people who are listening
I know that the past few weeks have not been easy.
You can’t wait to see your friends, go back to school and, yes, to have a break from your parents.
I know that it is even more difficult for youths who are members of the LGBTQ2 community.
It is often difficult at home, and you may be far from your support network.
We will continue to be there for you. And I know that, together, we will get through this.
Things will slowly get better.
So, continue to lend a hand around the house.
Continue to help your parents because, at the same time, you are helping society to face the crisis.
Hang in there, stay strong, and we’ll see you on the other side.
Thank you very much, everybody.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-15,"Hello everyone.
No matter who you are, the last few months will have changed your daily routine in ways big and small.
Canadians in every sector have faced challenges and tough choices at work.
And that includes people at research institutes, who are making the discoveries that keep us safe and healthy.
Science and research is our door to a brighter future, and that has never been clearer.   
But because of the pandemic, many labs have closed, or are at risk of imminently closing.
So, understandably, people are worried about their jobs and their future.
So today, we are announcing $450 million to help researchers and research institutions bridge to better times.
For universities and affiliated research institutes that have been affected by this pandemic, we will provide temporary support on wages.
By delivering this money through federal granting agencies, we will get help out as quickly as possible to the people who need it. 
Canada is lucky to have some of the best researchers in the world.
Every day, they make discoveries that keep us safe and healthy.
So we need to support them.
Far too many Canadians have lost their jobs because of COVID-19.
As our economy gradually reopens, wherever we can do so safely, we need you back.
We need you in your job, on your team, bringing life into our communities and our economy.
That’s exactly why we brought in the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy back in March.
Because, wherever possible, we wanted to keep you connected to the job you love, and to the workplace where you contribute every day.
When we launched this program, I talked about the neighbourhood spots it would support – the local restaurant, the salon, the gym – that had been forced to close, or seen business dry up.
Well, today, a lot of these places are looking towards reopening.
And they need to be able to bring back workers, and even hire more, as this happens. 
So this morning, I can confirm that we will extend the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy by another three months, to the end of August.
If you are a business owner preparing to reopen, this benefit will be there for you and your staff.
Business owners: Please take confidence from this announcement.
You now have some runway to catch your breath as you get restarted.
So please, bring back your employees.
Going forward, we need to make sure this program keeps working for people.
That it keeps encouraging employers to rehire staff, and even expand where possible.
So, over the next month, we’ll work with business and labour stakeholders on any adjustments that might be needed.
One of the things we’ll be looking at is the 30 per cent revenue decline threshold for eligibility.
As businesses start up, needing a decline shouldn’t be a barrier to growth.
I know we’ll figure out solutions where needed, while continuing to support employers and employees.
Because that’s who this is all about. 
If you’re a business owner, if you’re a worker – we’re here for you, now and throughout the summer.
At the same time, we’ve also broadened eligibility for this benefit.
Minister Morneau will have more details shortly, but these changes will get even more people back on the job.   
So to business owners who haven’t applied yet, go online and do so.
The help is there for you.
Last March, we anticipated more support for parents and workers, for students and seniors, for the hardest hit industries and for small businesses.
And today we are following through on our commitments.
Today kicks off this year’s hiring period for Canada Summer Jobs.
The first set of job postings are up on the Job Bank website, and thousands more will be posted over the coming weeks.
If you’re a student or recent grad, go to jobbank.gc.ca, that’s jobbank.gc.ca, or download the Job Bank app to check it out.
And tell your friends about it, too, if they don’t already know.
There are lots of opportunities available.
These placements mean a paycheque and valuable experience, in jobs that are key to our fight against COVID-19.
Of course, no one program can single-handedly solve the fact that there are fewer jobs out there because of the pandemic.
So, for students and recent grads who still need help, starting today, you can apply for the Canada Emergency Student Benefit.
Go to canada.ca to sign up.
Although everyone should do their best to file their taxes in time for the new June 1 deadline, your benefits won’t automatically be cut off if for some reason you miss that date.
Your CCB and GST/HST benefits will continue until the end of September.
But be sure in order to keep getting them, you need to file your taxes as soon as you can, so there’s enough time for the paperwork to be processed and you’ll be able to continue receiving those benefits beyond September.
This is a challenging time for everyone.
By working together and being there for one another, we’ll get through this.
Thank you.
","Prime Minister’s remarks on support for research staff, businesses, and students",https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/15/prime-ministers-remarks-support-research-staff-businesses-and-students
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-14,"Good morning everyone.
Over the last two months, we’ve seen our women and men in uniform step up to the plate again and again.
In seniors’ homes, in Northern communities, they are there for where we need them most.
And because they respond to the call of duty without hesitation, whenever they’re called upon, it can be easy to forget the toll this work can take.
Members of the Canadian Armed Forces have always been there to do tough, dangerous jobs.
So we need to be there for them, too.
So, after a lifetime of service, far too many veterans live with chronic pain.
Today, we are launching the Chronic Pain Centre of Excellence for Canadian Veterans at McMaster University.
This Centre will focus on national research, training, and education to provide veterans with the support they deserve.
No one, least of all those who have worn the maple leaf, should be without the care they need.
To all those who have served Canada—thank you. 
The entire country is grateful to you and we are here to support you.
Later today, I’ll also be meeting with nurses here in Ottawa to thank them for their outstanding work.
I know I speak for all Canadians when I say that we are incredibly grateful to the women and men who are keeping us safe right now. 
Over the last two months, a lot of Canadians have faced very challenging situations and very difficult choices.
Just take workers in the fisheries industry.
You can’t harvest lobster from inside your house.
So that leaves you trying to figure out how to either space people out on a fishing boat, or cancel your operations.
It’s not an easy call to make.
On top of that, prices and demand have gone down, putting financial pressure on fishers and their families.
Taken together, this adds up to a really tough time.
So I want you to know that we’re listening.
That your local MPs are making sure your concerns are heard.
And above all, that help is on the way.
Today, I can announce that we are investing almost $470 million to support fish harvesters.
First of all, we are creating the Fish Harvesters Benefit.
If you’re expecting a 25 per cent drop in income this year’s seasons, you’ll get support to cover 75 per cent of your losses, up to about $10,000.
And as a reminder, if you qualify for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy instead, remember that we’ll be extending it beyond June.
We’re also introducing additional non-repayable grants of up to $10,000 for fish harvesters who own their own business, and need support to bridge to better times.
And for workers who are worried about next year, we will change Employment Insurance rules so that fish harvesters can apply for EI benefits based on the earnings of previous years.
This all builds on the investments we’ve made for fish and seafood processers.
And for farmers and aquaculture fisheries, we’re also launching a $100 million Agriculture and Food Business Solutions Fund through Farm Credit Canada.
This is yet another option to help agri-food companies facing unexpected financial strain.
Whether you’re a fisher, a food processer, or a farmer – You feed our families.
We are listening to you to find out what you need to get through this crisis.
We’ve got your back.
And I know all Canadians do, too.
And everyone who wants to show their support, buy Canadian.
Pick up some Canadian cheese to help a local dairy farmer.
Have a “fish fry” or buy Canadian lobster.
Not only will it taste great, but it will help the people who keep putting food on our plates
I now want to talk about what we’re doing to support Indigenous peoples who are facing specific difficulties during the pandemic.
Since day one, our government has been engaging with First Nations, Inuit, and Metis Nation leaders in the fight against this virus.
We have allocated over $306 million for interest-free loans and non-repayable contributions for Indigenous businesses.
We are providing over $75 million in targeted support for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis students and are helping young people find jobs in their communities this summer.
And we have invested $10 million in emergency shelters for Indigenous women and children who are fleeing violence.
We have made significant progress, but we know there is still work to be done.
In places like Northern Saskatchewan that are dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks, it’s become very clear that communities need this work to continue.
That’s why yesterday, we announced support for the Meadow Lake Tribal Council and Metis Nation-Saskatchewan, for their Pandemic Response Plan.
Through this plan, we’re partnering with communities to provide over $2.3 million for everything from food to supplies.
We all want the same thing – to keep people safe.
And we will continue coordinating to make sure that happens.
I want to end today by recognizing that the May long weekend is coming up.
It will be different than normal because lots of places, including our National Parks, are still closed.
But this isn’t forever.
Canadians have been doing the right things these past many weeks.
And that’s why we can announce today some good news for the weeks ahead.
As of the beginning of June, some National Parks will be partially re-opening so that people in the area can use trails and green spaces where physical distancing is possible.
Getting fresh air is important, but we all have to be responsible about it.
And we have to be prepared to make adjustments as needed.
That’s why, with the weather getting better, we’re bringing in new regulations on boating as of June 1, to protect vulnerable communities in the North.
No pleasure craft will be permitted to operate in Canada’s Arctic coastal waters, or in the coastal areas of northern Quebec and Labrador.
Of course, this ban does not include boats used for essential fishing and hunting, or for local community use.
This is what we need to do to protect one another.
But, we have to remember that this will not be forever.

",Prime Minister’s remarks on support for Indigenous peoples and fish harvesters during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/14/prime-ministers-remarks-support-indigenous-peoples-and-fish-harvesters
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-13,"Hello everyone.
Today, I want to start by highlighting some good news.
Last night, Health Canada announced that it has authorized the first serological test for COVID-19 antibodies.
This is a critical step for the work of the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, which now has a safe and approved test that can detect antibodies specific to COVID-19 in an individual’s blood.
These tests will help us better understand immunity against the virus and how it spreads, so we can keep Canadians safe and healthy.
I now want to turn to what we’re doing to help employers keep their employees.
Over the past few weeks, our government has unveiled a number of measures to help businesses stay afloat during the crisis.
We want to make sure that as many Canadians as possible can keep getting their paycheck now and have a job to come back to once the pandemic is behind us.
Because that day will come. And when it does, Canada needs to be ready.
Our government has been laying the groundwork for our economic recovery. And we know that key to our collective success is maintaining the connection between employer and employee.
So, to help businesses of all sizes keep people on the payroll, we launched the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
We also introduced the Canada Emergency Business Account to support those struggling with cash flow.
These measures are making a real difference in people’s lives.
So far, more than half a million small businesses have received a loan through the CEBA.
And, over 120,000 employers have been approved to receive the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy for almost two million workers.
We also announced more targeted support for regional businesses, including those operating in the tourism sector and seasonal industries. We created a nearly $1 billion Regional Relief and Recovery Fund to ensure that they’re also getting the support they need during this time.
The funding will flow through the six Regional Development Agencies, with a portion dedicated to the Community Futures Network to assist businesses in rural and remote regions.
Today, we’re releasing more details on how that money will be split between the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions, FedDev Ontario, FedNor, Western Economic Diversification Canada, and CanNor.
And here’s the bottom line.
These organizations understand the economic realities and specific challenges facing both your region and your business.
They can help you with your most pressing needs – whether it’s covering costs or keeping your employees.
So, if you’re struggling but did not qualify for other programs like the wage subsidy or the emergency business account, give them a call. They’re there for you.
From the outset, our government has been focused on getting people the help they need as quickly as possible.
We announced support not just for businesses and their employees, but for different groups of people who’ve been hit especially hard by the pandemic. 
A few weeks ago, we launched the Canada Emergency Student Benefit as part of our $9 billion plan to help young people get through the next few months.
This morning I also have some news for students and recent graduates.
I can confirm that students and recent graduates will be able to apply for this benefit starting Friday.
To prepare for that, if you haven’t already signed up for the MyAccount on the CRA website, it’s worth doing this now to make the next steps go even quicker.
Because of COVID-19, there are fewer summer jobs for students. And you need to work during the summer months to pay your tuition or cover your day-to-day expenses in the coming year.
The Canada Emergency Student Benefit will be there to help you.
I would like to close this morning by reminding everyone to continue following the recommendations of public health experts.
We have heard a lot recently about gradually restarting the economy. I know everyone is looking forward to it, but we must remain vigilant.
So continue to stay home as much as possible and remember to keep your distance when you go out.
We will get through this together.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks updating Canadians on COVID-19 and funding through the Regional Development Agencies,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/13/prime-ministers-remarks-updating-canadians-covid-19-and-funding-through
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-12,"Hello everyone.
Before we get into things, I want to note that earlier this morning, Minister Gould announced a significant contribution to the Vaccine Alliance, GAVI, and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
These organizations deliver vaccines to some of the world’s most vulnerable, saving millions of lives. Most recently, GAVI is also helping developing countries build capacity to respond to disease outbreaks like COVID-19.
Once a COVID-19 vaccine is available, GAVI will help get it to the people who need it.
And that will keep us all safer. Because in our interconnected world, to end this pandemic for good in Canada, we have to end it everywhere.
As we know all too well, the last few weeks have been especially difficult for our seniors and their families.
Our parents and our grandparents are more at risk of catching COVID-19 and of suffering the worst consequences of it.
All across the country, long-term care facilities and seniors’ residences have been hit the hardest by the pandemic, exposing the flaws in a system that must be strengthened.
But the challenges that the pandemic presents to seniors are not limited to what is happening in long-term care facilities and residences.
The lockdown is weighing heavily on seniors all across the country.
They are spending a lot of time alone, separated from their families.
And because they have to avoid going out as much as possible, they cannot use transit.
They are relying on delivery services to get their groceries and this often means they cannot take advantage of in-store sales.
This is hard on their morale and on their finances.
Today, our government is announcing new measures to support seniors during this pandemic.
First, if you’re receiving Old Age Security, you will get an additional $300 to offset some of the extra costs you’ve had to cover because of the virus.
This means that, across the country, almost 7 million seniors will get help that they need.
And to better support the most vulnerable seniors, we will also give an extra $200 to people who are eligible for the Guaranteed Income Supplement.
So, if you’re receiving both OAS and GIS, you will get an additional $500 in total to help you.
Our government is also investing an additional $20 million in the New Horizons for Seniors Program.
A few weeks ago, we boosted funding so that organizations could adapt their services to the realities of the pandemic, provide delivery services and help seniors stay in touch with family.
So, we’re making another investment today to create more programs to help isolated seniors and improve their quality of life.
Now, there’s no question that COVID-19 has been taking its toll on seniors both emotionally and financially.
And with today’s announcement, our government is taking action to alleviate some of the stress they may be feeling.
But there’s a lot more work to be done not only to find short-term fixes, but long-term solutions.
COVID-19 has exposed some uncomfortable truths about our society, including how we care for seniors in Canada.
We’ve seen heartbreaking tragedies in long-term care facilities and nursing homes right across the country.
Overworked staff. Understaffed residences. Grieving families.
There are serious, underlying challenges facing these facilities. And in the coming months, the federal government will be there to help the provinces find lasting solutions. 
Every Canadian—no matter where they live or what they do—has a role to play in supporting our seniors during this pandemic.
It starts with following public health recommendations.
You know the drill—staying home, washing our hands, and keeping a safe distance from others when we go out.
That’s how we can protect the physical health of our parents and grandparents during this pandemic, but let’s not forget about their mental health.
A lot of people—especially single seniors—are feeling really lonely right now.
So, call your grandparents. Ask them how their day is going, how they’re doing, and how you can help.
Consider writing a letter or a postcard to isolated seniors, or volunteer with a local organization to fight the isolation of seniors.
We need to be there for those who have built this country for the rest of us and that’s what Canadians will continue to do.
And together, we will get through this.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks announcing additional support for seniors,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/12/prime-ministers-remarks-announcing-additional-support-seniors
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-11,"Good morning.
I’d like to begin today by recognizing that this is National Nursing Week.
Nurses are the heart and soul of our health care system.
Every day, they do incredible work to keep Canadians healthy, and the way they’ve stepped up to support people during this pandemic speaks to their compassion, resilience, and dedication.
To all the nurses out there – thank you so much for going above and beyond not just these days, but every day.
Since the beginning, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been driven by three fundamental objectives.
The first is to keep Canadians safe and ensure we take every possible step to protect our most vulnerable citizens.
This work continues daily, guided by our best doctors and medical experts, and it drives every move we make.
The second is to protect individuals, workers, and families from the worst financial impacts of the pandemic. So you can put food on the table and cover your bills while staying safe.  
We are doing that with programs such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, the increase in the Canada Child Benefit this month, and the enhanced GST tax credit, among other measures.
And thirdly, we are helping Canadian businesses through this extraordinary time – including for-profit, not-for-profit, and charitable enterprises – to ensure that workers across Canada can keep their jobs.
So we can coming roaring back after this difficult time is behind us.
Today, I am announcing the next phase of our support for enterprises that collectively employ millions of Canadians, and are experiencing unprecedented losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are expanding the Business Credit Availability Program, put in place to keep small businesses solvent, to mid-sized companies with a greater need for capital.  
Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank of Canada will work with private-sector lenders to free up access to capital, in the tens of millions, for Canadian companies in every industry and in all regions across Canada.
At the same time, we are establishing a Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility, to provide bridge financing for our largest employers, if they are unable to obtain financing through other means.
But let me be clear.
These are bridge loans - not bailouts.
Just as we are finding ways to support small and medium-sized businesses, we’ll provide loans to the largest enterprises to help them weather the storm, and protect the millions of jobs they provide across Canada.
In providing this support, we will be guided by several basic principles.
The first, is to avoid bankruptcies: our purpose is to keep large Canadian companies on their feet, and protect the millions of jobs they provide.
The goal here is not to fix pre-existing insolvencies or restructurings. Nor is it to provide low-cost lending to companies that don’t need it.
Second, we will be fair.  
Financing will be accessible to every industry sector, in a way that is consistent in every province and territory, right across Canada.
And critically, we will protect workers, and hold companies accountable. This is fundamental.
Any company that receives this support will be expected to make and keep certain commitments.
Those include maintaining jobs and investment; respecting collective agreements and pension obligations; and environmental and climate commitments. 
In particular, there will be strict limits on dividends, share buy-backs, and executive compensation.
To stand strong against tax avoidance and tax evasion, we will require companies to share with us their complete financial structure as they apply for funding.
With this program, we are taking a bold step.
Ideally, private-sector lenders are adequate for the needs of large businesses. But in an extraordinary situation when that isn’t always enough, we must act to prevent massive harm to Canadian workers and families, and the Canadian economy.
We will not allow millions of people to lose their livelihoods, because of unprecedented events beyond their control.
Finally, as we continue to work on plans to re-open, I want to say this.
Please let caution and medical advice be your guides.
We are all anxious to see life go back to something that looks more like normal.
But we’re not out of the woods, yet. And we cannot squander the sacrifices we have made over the past two months.
So when in doubt, if you can – stay home. Avoid gatherings. Wash your hands, frequently and thoroughly. And maintain two-metres distance from everyone else.
This is how we keep our fellow Canadians who can’t stay home and those working on the front lines, safe.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on additional support for businesses,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/11/prime-ministers-remarks-additional-support-businesses
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-09,"Happy Saturday everyone.
These days, a number of Canadians are going through hard times because of COVID-19.
The pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for our country, and Canadians are suffering the consequences.
However, some people and sectors are more deeply affected than others.
Therefore, this week, we announced other measures to help those that need them the most.
First, we are working on concluding an agreement with all of the provinces and territories to increase the salaries of essential workers.
These people have been on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 since the start of the crisis. They are doing incredible work.
The best way to thank them is to ensure that they are well paid and protected.
And this week, thanks to this agreement, we are in the process of taking an important step towards putting more money in their pockets.
We also announced more support to help the food sector get through this crisis.
We are giving food processors more money to ensure the security of their workers.
We are planning on specific measures to help cattle and pork farmers, and dairy producers, adapt to market changes.
We are implementing a program that will help the government purchase products that are likely to be wasted, to redistribute them to charity organizations.
All in all, our government has proposed an additional $5 billion in lending capacity and a total investment of $510 million to support food security since the beginning of the crisis.
And as I said earlier this week, if we have to do more, we will do more.
For the past few weeks, our government has been focused on getting people the help they need as quickly as possible.
But to come out of this stronger than ever, we also have to think long-term.
We need to lay the groundwork now, so our economy can come roaring back.
So far, more than half a million small businesses have received a loan through the CEBA.
And less than two weeks since launching the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, employers have applied for subsidies for almost two million workers.
Our government is giving employers more resources, so they can stay in business and keep people on the payroll during this crisis.
Maintaining the connection between employer and employee will be key not just to help people get back on their feet, but also to our economy.
In that vein, we announced yesterday that we would be extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy beyond June.
At the same time, we’re working with our partners from around the world to beat COVID-19 for good.
This pandemic is a global issue.
Keeping Canadians safe and restarting our economy means defeating the virus not just at home, but wherever it is found.
So earlier this week, we announced new investments to accelerate the global development of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, testing, and research, including research being done here in Canada.
Over the past few weeks, we established new assistance programs for workers and businesses, but we know that the work is far from complete.
As the situation evolves, needs and challenges also evolve and we adapt our response accordingly.
We are still listening to Canadians and still looking for ways to support them.
I want to close by asking all the moms to step out of the room for a minute so I can talk to your kids.
Okay, tomorrow is Mother’s Day, kids.
It’s a special day for all the people who are mothers to us – our moms, stepmoms, grandmothers, aunts, and older sisters.
So, let’s show them how much we love and care about them.
You might want to get up early to make her breakfast or ask dad to help you get her some flowers.
Or if you’re not together this year because of the virus or other reasons, you can draw her a card or set up a video call.
Whatever you do, I’m sure what you’ll choose to do will make her day and express how much you love her, how much you need her, and how much she has your full support and full love during this difficult time, but all the time as well.
Take advantage of this time and have fun. We will get through this together.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-09-24,"Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It is with a heavy heart that I rise today in this House to pay tribute to the late Right Honourable John Turner, Canada’s 17th Prime Minister.
I knew John my whole life, and he believed fiercely in the values that make us who we are as Canadians.
Values like treating everyone with dignity and respect. And always being willing to stand up for what is just and right. 
Today, we remember him as a House of Commons man – a strong advocate for equality and a champion of our democracy.  
Mr. Speaker, we live in a wonderful country, and it is thanks in part to people like John Turner.
John’s commitment to democracy started very early in his life. When he was young, his mother taught him the importance of public service.   
Throughout his career – first as a lawyer and later as a politician – he always demonstrated grace and humility.
John treated everyone with dignity and respect. No matter how busy he was, he never forgot anyone’s birthday. 
As an MP, John had the privilege of serving three different provinces.
His work as Minister of Justice paved the way for legal aid in Canada, to ensure that everyone’s rights were recognized – no matter their economic or cultural profile.
These changes have transformed the lives of millions of Canadians.
Mr. Speaker, when talking about John, it’s easy to see how much he loved Canada.
John always spoke of his country with great hope and optimism.
To him, Canada is a country where we help each other and we respect each other. A country where equality is a way of life.
It was just last year that John was on the Hill to celebrate his 90th birthday with people from across the political spectrum. And I remember how he was still passionate about strengthening our democratic institutions.
He used to say that “democracy doesn’t happen by accident.”
He was right.
John knew that keeping our democracy strong and free meant we needed to put in the hard work to keep it that way.
He believed in the incredible power of young people to get involved in our democratic process, and encouraged them to do that, wherever he could. 
John knew Canadians, regardless of age or background, formed the heart of our country, and that our future depended on all of us working together, for everyone.
Today, as we mourn his loss and reflect on his legacy, let’s all remember our ability to give back to our own communities.
To his wife Geills, their children Elizabeth, Michael, David, and Andrew, to John’s grandchildren, his sister Brenda Norris, and brother-in-law David Kilgour – your husband, loving father, and brother was a great Canadian.
We are all so lucky you shared him with us.
To my fellow Canadians, I invite you to join us in signing the virtual book of condolences.   
And together, let us continue to work to defend and strengthen our democracy, and as John once said, “let’s not take this country for granted.”
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-09-23,"Hello everyone.
My fellow Canadians, good evening. In the West, good afternoon.
I want to speak directly to you today because Canada is at a crossroads. 
I know that the fight against COVID-19 has been difficult for all Canadians over the past six months.
For too many people, it’s a matter of life and death.
And for all of us, collectively, it’s the fight of our generation. 
In the spring, we all worked together to flatten the curve, and our efforts paid off. But now, the virus is coming back in full force in several parts of the country.
In our four biggest provinces, the second wave isn’t just starting – it’s already underway.
The numbers are clear. Back on March 13 when we went into lockdown, there were 47 new cases of COVID-19. Yesterday alone, we had well over 1,000.
I know this isn’t the news that any of us wanted to hear. And we can’t change today’s numbers or even tomorrow’s – those were already decided by what we did, or didn’t do, two weeks ago.
But what we can change is where we are in October, and into the winter. It’s all too likely we won’t be gathering for Thanksgiving, but we still have a shot at Christmas.
Together, we have the power to get this second wave under control.
I know we can do it, because we’ve already done it once before. In the spring, we all did our part by staying home. And this fall, we have even more tools in the toolbox.
People are wearing masks. That’s critical, so keep it up.
We’ve got the COVID Alert app.
Take the teacher who felt fine, but who tested positive after the app warned her she’d been exposed. COVID Alert meant she went home instead of the classroom. 
It’s a powerful, free tool that’s easy to use and protects your privacy. So if you haven’t already, download it off the App Store or Google Play Store. It’s one more way to keep ourselves and others safe.
Another is to get your flu shot this fall.
The steps we’re taking today will make all the difference in what will happen in two weeks and in two months.
Wear a mask – it saves lives.
Wash your hands.
Keep your distance.
Get your flu shot.
Listen to public health agencies. As Dr. Tam said yesterday, limit your social circle. Avoid taking unnecessary risks.
This is not the time to have parties.
No one is invincible. Your loved ones aren’t invincible. 
We cannot let our guard down, even in places where the number of cases is still low.
And everybody, please, download the COVID Alert app. It is free and easy to use, it protects your privacy, and it will protect you and the people around you.
This is the time for all of us, as Canadians, to do our part for our country, as the government does its part for you.
There is a covenant between the government and the people that the government serves.
You need to know that you can rely on us, just like you can rely on each other.
As we face this crisis, as we get ready to rebuild, we will continue to be there for you.
The government put forth a four-part plan to respond to this crisis.
The first thing we have to do is to protect people’s health.
The actions of our parents and grandparents – the generation that faced the Great Depression and the Second World War – remind us that we have to be resilient and patient in times of crisis. They built the world of today. Now it’s up to us to build the world of tomorrow, and we have to start by protecting them.
The situation experienced by too many of our seniors in long-term care centres is unacceptable.
It must change, and it will change.
In the spring, we sent the Canadian Armed Forces to help, and the Canadian Red Cross is still on the ground.
We will work immediately with the provinces and territories to establish new national standards for long-term care.
Job one is keeping people safe.
In fact, because we mobilized this spring, Canadians are now producing almost every type of PPE we need.
We’re helping the provinces and territories ramp up their capacity on testing, while creating a federal response team for surge demand. And, as soon as there’s approval for faster tests to be used safely, we’ll get them out across the country. If you need a test, you should be able to get one, and get it quickly. This is about safety, and it’s about what’s right for Canadians.
Protecting your health is the best thing we can do for the economy.
So that’s what we’re working on first.
And that brings me to the second part of the plan – supporting Canadians through this pandemic.
The federal government will have your back, whatever it takes, to help you get through this crisis.
Maybe you were one of the almost nine million people who used the Canada Emergency Response Benefit this spring. We will continue to support all those who need it with a strengthened and broadened Employment Insurance system.
Maybe your boss was able to keep you on the job, or hire you back, because the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy helped with the payroll. People still need this program, so we’re extending it right through to next summer.
Or perhaps you’re a business owner, needing extra help to bridge to better times. For you, among other measures, we’re expanding the Canada Emergency Business Account.
And there’s a lot more we’re going to do.
Go to Canada.ca/coronavirus to see what support is available right now, and how to apply.
I know some people are asking how we can afford to do all this for Canadians. That’s fair.
Low interest rates mean we can afford it. And in fact, doing less would end up costing far more. Doing less would mean a slower recovery and bigger deficits in the long run.
While we’re dealing with this pandemic, I don’t want you – or your parent, or your friend – to take on debt that your government can better shoulder.
So yes, in the short term, we’ll keep investing.  
But beyond the emergency, as we start to build back better, we must do that in a fiscally sustainable way. Investing for our recovery must be done responsibly.
You know, the pandemic is revealing the fundamental inequalities in our society, but now, we have the opportunity to take action to change that.
We will build a better society for everyone, while at the same time making the economy better for everyone.
This is the third part of the government’s approach.
By creating a Canada-wide early learning and childcare system, we’ll ensure that kids have access to care, and that no parent – especially no mother – has to put their career on hold.
This pandemic has reminded us all that building strong social supports is essential to growing the economy.
By accelerating progress on national, universal pharmacare, we’ll get people the medicine they need, while alleviating pressure on the health care system.
By investing to eliminate chronic homelessness, we will create healthier, more prosperous communities.
Housing is not just a problem – it’s also a solution.
It creates jobs.
It enables people to grow and contribute. 
We all want to build a stronger country for everyone. To do this, we must redouble our efforts to fight climate change.
This is also the best way to ensure good jobs for today and for the future.
Energy workers innovating to decarbonize. Auto workers building zero-emissions vehicles. Engineers and construction workers delivering green retrofits for our homes and buildings. 
These are some of the people who will create a competitive economy of the future.
As we do this work – protecting people’s health, supporting Canadians, building back better – we can’t forget what it’s all for:
Making sure that everyone can participate to their full potential. And that’s the final part of the plan.
As a country, we must keep making progress on reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, and on fighting systemic racism.
Diversity is not just our strength, it’s our competitive edge.
Our differences make us stronger, no matter the colour of our skin, our beliefs, our culture, or our language.
In our country, we are proud to have two official languages – English and French – that we will continue to protect.
In Canada, we know that we are stronger when we come together and when we help each other. We face challenges together.  
That is what has helped us manage the crisis better than many others.
This is not the first time our country has been called to stand united and strong.
In the face of change, our Greatest Generation showed us that overcoming crisis isn’t easy.
They didn’t give up. And neither can we.
To parents feeling like you can’t get your life under control;
To kids wondering why mom and dad can’t just fix this;
To seniors feeling like there’s nothing you can do, and thinking about all the things you can’t do:
That’s understandable.
But can’t will not define us.
We can bend the curve.
We can build a stronger future.
We can define the change.
As Canadians, we are people who say, “I can”.
In every sector, all across the country, every one of us is doing our part.
The story of this pandemic is the story of people who are making sacrifices. It’s the story of people who work hard every day to be there for each other.
This is especially the story of our front line workers – heroes, from coast to coast to coast, who have never hesitated, who have never backed down from this fight.
You are an inspiration to us all.
We are at a crossroads, and the future is in our hands.
There are many days to go before we get to the other side of this.
But there are also many of us to get us there, so long as we each remember to do our part. And I know that we will.
We are Canadians.  
And together, there’s nothing we can’t do.
Take care of yourselves, my friends.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks addressing Canadians on the COVID-19 situation,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/09/23/prime-ministers-remarks-addressing-canadians-covid-19-situation
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-09-16,"Good morning everyone.
Thanks for being here today.
We just wrapped up a Cabinet retreat here in Ottawa to map out our plan to keep Canadians safe and healthy, while building a more resilient Canada.
Canada and the world continue to face the ongoing threat of the global pandemic.
Over the last few months, we’ve learned that we can never let our guard down.
The fight against COVID-19 is far from over.
So we must stay focused on the task ahead.
We need to rebuild our economy while keeping Canadians safe.
These two goals are not mutually exclusive – they go together.
Healthier Canadians will mean, and has already meant, a healthier and stronger economy.
And on that front, today, we took yet another step forward.
Through the Safe Restart Agreement, reached earlier this summer, we announced federal funding to help provinces and territories safely restart the economy.
Provinces and territories were asked to outline in a letter just how these funds would be best allocated within their jurisdictions, based on their priorities.
The premiers have now submitted those letters which will allow over $19 billion in federal funding to flow toward our shared work to protect Canadians as we safely restart the economy.
The number of cases is rising across the country, and around the world.
Kids are also now going back to school and as a dad, I get how parents are worried.
Last month, we announced the Safe Return to Class Fund to help protect kids and staff with up to an extra $2 billion for the provinces and territories.  
Keeping our kids safe must always be our top priority.
This is why I’m asking Canadians to continue to be careful and to follow public health recommendations.
Limit the in-person contacts that you have. Take the appropriate precautions to reduce the risk of exposure so that you and your family stay safe, and download the government app to keep you and your friends and neighbours safe.
Every effort counts.
The Cabinet retreat has been very busy over the past few days.
It was an opportunity to get together to continue to develop our approach to this new world in which we live.
The Speech from the Throne will describe this approach in detail for Canadians next week.
We must continue to support Canadians in need during this crisis.
The pandemic has accentuated many of the inequalities that still exist in our society.
We must seize the opportunity of this economic recovery to build a healthier and safer Canada.
A Canada that’s fair and inclusive.
A Canada that’s clean and competitive.
On Monday, the COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force provided Cabinet with an update on their important work.
Dr. Tam also shared her thoughts on where we are in the fight against this virus and what we need to work on in the coming months.
We also heard from Sharleen Stewart, the President of the SEIU Healthcare union, who spoke about the challenges ahead this fall and winter, for long-term care, with a particular focus on how we must support those extraordinary workers who keep our elders safe and healthy.  
I am also pleased to confirm that we have accepted a request from the Quebec government to extend the mission of the Canadian Red Cross in Quebec long-term care facilities or CHSLDs. We responded from the start of the crisis, first with the Canadian Armed Forces and now with the Canadian Red Cross, and we are pleased to be able to continue to support our seniors.
Last weekend, a number of countries in Europe and around the world reported record daily increases of new cases.
We’re not immune to those trends.
Here in Canada, we’re seeing cases rise in many parts of the country too.
As everybody knows by now, each new case has the potential to multiply, and create even more cases.
So we are not out of the woods.
This is why I’m asking Canadians to continue to be very careful and follow public health recommendations.
Limit the in-person close contacts that you have.
Take appropriate precautions to reduce the risk of exposure, and keep yourself and your family safe.
And make sure you download the COVID Alert app.
These efforts help protect our grandparents, our parents, our front-line workers, and vulnerable people in our communities.
We have to show solidarity to keep each other safe.
We’ve come too far to give up now.
Together, Canadians must stay strong and vigilant. 
This afternoon, I also want to talk about jobs.
Lots of people are back at work, and that’s good news.
But I know that there are lots more people who are still struggling.
And there are many others who are worried that they could lose their job in these uncertain times.
If that’s you, know that your government will continue to be here to support you.
This pandemic has highlighted many of the inequalities that still exist in our society.
More than ever, we need an economy that benefits all Canadians.
During this retreat, and over the weeks and months to come, that’s exactly what our government will stay focused on.
To build a resilient Canada, our economy must be strong, and all Canadians must be able to benefit from it.
Our country must continue to be well-positioned on the world stage to attract investment and talent from around the world.
To discuss what to expect this fall, as well as Canada’s place in the global economic recovery and the fight against COVID-19, we spoke with Ambassador Rae, Ambassador Barton, and Ambassador Hillman.
Yesterday’s decision by the U.S. administration to remove unjustified tariffs on Canadian aluminum was the right thing to do.
This is very good news for both of our countries, as well as for Canadian aluminum workers.
When it comes to defending our workers and our economic interests, whether it is for aluminum or any other sector, we will always stand up for ourselves.
Aluminum trade between Canada and the United States has long been good for people on both sides of the border.
It supports jobs, and it grows our economies.  
I want to thank Minister Freeland, Minister Ng, and Ambassador Hillman for their hard work on this important issue.
Our government will always stand up for Canadian workers.
Yesterday, I also had a call with Chancellor Merkel of Germany.
We talked about the global response to COVID-19, from vaccine plans to our experiences with back to school.
We also discussed smart ways to grow our economies going forward in what has become a more unstable world.
And we both reiterated our condemnation of the poisoning of Russian opposition figure, Alexei Navalny. On the world stage, Canada will continue to work with our G7 allies and other international partners, to come up with bold solutions to the challenges we face.
And here at home, we will continue to work closely with provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous peoples, and businesses to drive the most important economic recovery of our generation.
Canadians deserve an ambitious plan for a healthier and safer Canada.
A Canada that’s fair and inclusive.
A Canada that’s clean and competitive.
And with the Speech from the Throne on September 23, that’s exactly what our government is ready to do.
Once again, I want to thank you all for joining us today.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-09-11,"Hello everyone.
Thank you Paul, thank you Marc for that introduction. And thanks to all of you for your exceptional work representing the people of Sudbury and Nickel Belt.
I know how important it is for you that middle class people have access to good jobs, which makes it even more wonderful to be here with you today.
It’s great to be here today with Premier Ford. Doug – it’s always good to see you again.
We also have Sudbury Mayor Brian Bigger and Timmins Mayor George Pirie.
And I’d like to take a moment to thank Chief Boissoneau for his welcome and Chief Ray for joining us, and IAMGOLD CEO Gord Stothart for welcoming us this morning.
Before we begin, I’d like to recognize that today marks 19 years since the horrific terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.
Today, we remember the people we lost in this unthinkable tragedy.
They were neighbours, friends, and family. As we pay tribute to their lives, let’s also remember the bravery and the sacrifice of all the first responders who arrived on the scene and rushed into buildings as others were fleeing.
On Canada’s National Day of Service, we recognize everyone across the country who risks their lives to help others. 
In the last few months, Canadians have seen the tremendous sacrifices of women and men on the frontlines, working day and night to keep us safe. 
On behalf of all Canadians, thank you for what you’ve done, and continue to do, for our country.
It’s great to be here at the ground-breaking of the Côté Gold mine. I know that this is not just big news for the people of Gogama, but also for folks in Sudbury, Timmins, and right across Northern Ontario.
During construction, this project will create more than a thousand good jobs for people in the area, as well as 450 full-time positions once it’s completed.
This project was made possible by international partner Sumitomo Metal, and went through an environmental assessment done by Environment and Climate Change Canada.
We introduced the Canadian Minerals and Metals Plan to support projects just like this one – projects that make Canada a great place to do business – and create, and protect good, lasting jobs for Canadians.   
Earlier this year, I attended the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada’s Global Mineral Exploration and Mining Convention, in Toronto.
I remember talking about how rapidly the global economy is changing and why Canada needs to be a leader in the mining sector in order to keep good jobs in our communities.
Of course, months later, the global economy has changed. But there’s one thing that has not changed – the importance of projects like this one for workers, families, and our economy.
More than ever, we will need to rebuild our economy in way that’s inclusive and fair for everyone.
That’s why it’s wonderful to see that neighbouring First Nations, Flying Post First Nation and Mattagami First Nation, are also partners in this project.
This is another example of how, when we work together, we can create good jobs for communities across Canada.
There’s no doubt that the last few months have been hard for a lot of businesses across the country because of COVID-19. And the virus is still a health threat around the world and here at home.
So as we safely reopen our economy, it will take time for us to make up the economic ground we lost to the global pandemic, but this project shows how our economy is getting back on its feet.
International investors know that Canada is a good place to do business. Even as we face tough economic times around the world, global investors have confidence in Canadians.
Right now, we have an opportunity to build a more resilient Canada – a Canada that’s healthier and safer, more inclusive and fair.
A Canada that’s both greener, and more competitive in the global economy of the future, tackling the threat of climate change while creating good jobs for years to come. As anyone in the mining industry already knows – we can’t solve climate change without strong leadership from the natural resources sector.
Just take the Borden mine, which became Canada’s first all-electric mining facility. Innovations across this sector will be crucial for a green recovery, and will help drive the clean transition that we need.
From the nickel and cobalt that are used in batteries for electric vehicles and solar panels – the mining sector is really important in building a better future for us all.
So our government stands ready to work with companies to build that more resilient, healthier country, where everyone has a real and fair chance to succeed.
This sector has an opportunity to create good, sustainable jobs for Canadians, stimulate our economy and pave the way for a green restart. And that begins with projects like this one.
We will continue to work with all orders of government to ensure a better future for all Canadians.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-09-09,"Hello everyone.
I’m happy to be here at HXOUSE in Toronto with Minister Ng, Greg Fergus, the Chair of the Parliamentary Black Caucus, and Adam Vaughan, and Gary Anandasangaree.   
I also want to thank one of the co-founders of HXOUSE, Ahmed Ismail, for welcoming us today. I know that Abel Tesfaye, known as the Weeknd, and La Mar Taylor are also co-founders of HXOUSE, and wanted to be here but just couldn’t make it, so thanks to them as well.
We’re also joined by members of the local community, and representatives from some of Canada’s largest banks.
Over the last six months as our country faced the unprecedented challenge of COVID-19, we’ve seen that there exists still far too many gaps in our society.
For Black entrepreneurs, this pandemic has highlighted the many inequalities they face.
We need an economic recovery that’s inclusive and equitable for all Canadians. 
Earlier today, I talked with some local Black entrepreneurs about what starting a business means to them, and what the last few months have been like.
They told me what it was like to build the company of their dreams, and the importance of giving back to the community.  
The small businesses that Black entrepreneurs create are the backbone of our communities.
Just take the story of Thornton and Lucie Blackburn, two prominent Black Canadian entrepreneurs from the early 1800s.
After the Blackburns escaped from slavery, they became successful business owners, starting Toronto’s very first taxi company.
Here in Toronto, at the end of the Underground Railroad, the Blackburns brought a new dream to life.
A dream of building economic freedom through hard work, perseverance, and hope. 
A dream that gave them pride in creating something with their own two hands, and contributing to their community and their city.
They achieved that dream, all the while reaching back to help others move forward.  
Their legacy speaks to what Black business owners have always done, and still do for their communities.
From the Blackburns to Viola Desmond, Black business owners are at the very centre of their communities.
To Black entrepreneurs: we heard you when you said that investing in the right tools and support create good, sustainable jobs. You’re absolutely right.
An investment in Black excellence is an investment in economic empowerment.
And economic empowerment is an essential part of justice.
It’s justice against a system that has locked out far too many Black entrepreneurs, and denied them the same opportunities as other Canadians.
So today, we’re taking another step forward to reduce barriers and address that.
This morning, I can announce that the Government of Canada, in partnership with Canadian banks, is investing up to nearly $221 million to launch Canada’s first-ever Black Entrepreneurship Program.
The Government of Canada’s share will be up to nearly $93 million over four years as a part of this program.  
The Black Entrepreneurship Program will help thousands of Black business owners and entrepreneurs through our economic recovery, and into the months and years ahead.
I’d like to take a moment to thank our partners for working with us to address an issue Black Canadians have faced for far too long.
The Black Entrepreneurship Program will include funding to support three new initiatives – a National Ecosystem Fund, a Black Entrepreneurship Loan Fund, and a Black Entrepreneurship Knowledge Hub.
Let me start with the National Ecosystem Fund.
Black business owners and entrepreneurs often have a hard time getting the right tools and mentorship to succeed.  
With this new National Ecosystem Fund, Black entrepreneurs will have access to the financial planning services and business training they need for the months and years to come.
Black entrepreneurs also continue to face systemic barriers when it comes to accessing loans from financial institutions.
That’s what the second part of our program – the Black Entrepreneurship Loan Fund – will tackle.
With this new fund, Black businesses will be eligible for loans of up to $250,000.
That brings me to the third part of this program – the creation of a new Black Entrepreneurship Knowledge Hub.
To build back better, we need the best data possible to ensure future funding is more efficient.
This Hub will identify the barriers standing in the way of Black entrepreneurs, and highlight opportunities for future growth.
To get the right input from communities, the Hub will be run by Black-led business and community organizations, in partnership with universities and colleges.
Moving forward, Statistics Canada will continue to collect disaggregated data to better understand the needs of Black entrepreneurs.  
This announcement means a long-term investment in our communities and will help people reach their full potential.
The Black Entrepreneurship Program wouldn’t be possible without the leadership of Black business organizations.
I’d like to thank them for their hard work on building this new program with us.
This funding is another step in supporting the hopes and aspirations of Black Canadians.
And it’s another step towards our commitment to address the systemic racism that affects Black communities. 
We know there’s still more work to be done, and we’re committed to doing that work.
In the weeks and months to come, our government will continue to stand with all Canadians through this economic recovery.
We will continue to build a better, more equitable, more inclusive Canada, where everyone has a real and fair chance at success.
Our government understands that our people are our greatest asset.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-08-31,"Hello, everyone.
I am delighted to be here, at the National Research Council, with Minister Bains and my fellow members of Parliament from Montréal, Minister Joly, Rachel Bendayan and our local member, Anthony Housefather.
The President of the National Research Council, Iain Stewart, is also with us today.
From the start, our government’s fight against COVID-19 has been guided by science.
We have therefore invested over $1 billion in a COVID-19 strategy that allows for increased screening, and supports vaccine research and clinical trials.  
In order to protect Canadians, we must follow the advice of public health experts and support scientific research.
This means we also need to support our researchers as they develop an effective vaccine.
Earlier this month, Minister Bains and Minister Anand announced the names of the members of the COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force.
This group includes vaccine and immunology specialists, as well as industry leaders.
And, based on their advice, we have signed agreements with Pfizer and Moderna to reserve millions of doses of a future COVID-19 vaccine.
Today, I can announce that the Government of Canada has signed two new agreements with Novavax, and Johnson &amp; Johnson to reserve millions of doses of the vaccines they’re developing.   
Their most recent vaccine tests show promising results.
That’s why we’re making sure that if one of these potential vaccines is successful, Canada and Canadians will have access to the doses they need.
Taken together, our vaccine agreements with Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, will give Canada at least 88 million doses, with options to obtain tens of millions more.
I know that Minister Anand and Minister Hajdu will have more details to share at the noon briefing today.
In the weeks and months ahead, our government will continue to take the steps needed to make sure Canada gets a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible.
Once a vaccine is proven to work, we’ll also need to be able to produce and distribute it here at home.
On that front, I can also announce that we’re investing over $126 million to expand the bio-manufacturing facility right here at the Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre in Montréal.
This funding will increase this facility’s ability to manufacture vaccines, and will strengthen the NRC’s partnerships with vaccine developers.
We expect the facility to be up and running by mid-2021.
Terry’s courage and persistence made him a true Canadian hero, and gave hope to people around the world.
As we honour his legacy, let’s continue to support the people and families affected by cancer, and keep working together to find a cure.      
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-08-26,"Hello everyone.
It’s great to be here today at Yorkwoods Public School with Minister Hussen, and Members of Parliament Kirsty Duncan and Judy Sgro.
We’re also joined by Carlene Jackson and Alexander Brown from the TDSB, as well as School Trustee Chris Mammoliti. And to Principal Verma and Vice-Principal MacDonald – thank you for welcoming us here this morning.
I know the end of August is always busy as you get ready to welcome kids back.
And while every year is different, this September will be unlike any you’ve had to deal with before.
Parents and staff are anxious about what the school year may hold.
As a dad, and as a former teacher, I get that.
We all want what’s best for our kids, including a good education.
School matters – I got to see that first hand when I was in front of the classroom. And that’s why the tools we give to young people now to keep them safe, to allow them to be successful in the years to come in a world that is changing, a world that right now is more changed and more transformed than we’ve seen in a long time, getting them back to school safely and making sure them and their parents are confident about what they’re doing and how they’re doing it, really, really matters.
Just a few minutes ago, I had the chance to sit down with Joanne Luong and Phong Bui.
They have four kids, and they were telling me that they’re worried about sending them back to school.
Like every parent, Joanne and Phong want to make sure their children are safe.
But as owners of their own business, it’s also hard to juggle work with the kids at home.
This is something that a lot of parents – especially mothers – are facing right now.
Our children must be safe in the classroom.
That’s non-negotiable.
No parent should be losing sleep because they have to go back to work, but aren’t confident schools are properly prepared. 
My colleagues, the Premiers, are responsible for ensuring that our children are safe in their classrooms and that the teachers are safe on the job.
But our government will be there to help them.
As I have said before, the provinces and territories must make decisions based on public health advice, not budget limitations.
We have put our words into action and are providing federal funding to help them. 
Our government has already committed to investing an unprecedented $19 billion in the Safe Restart Agreement with the provinces and territories.
We’re doing this so we can give Canadians the support they need.
We’ve always promised to be there for Canadians, and that is exactly what we’re doing.
But, of course, there is still work to be done.
So today, we’re taking another step forward.
Yesterday, I spoke with Premiers about the upcoming school year.
They’re working hard to protect our kids.
But this year is challenging and like no other.
That’s why today, I can announce that the federal government is investing up to $2 billion in school safety for the coming year.
This money, which will flow through the new Safe Return to Class Fund, will help keep students and teachers safe as schools reopen.
Our children must always be our top priority – as parents and as governments.
Once people know their kids are safe, they can get back to work with less worries.
Education is, of course, a provincial jurisdiction, and I told the Premiers yesterday that we absolutely respect that.
What we’re announcing today is designed to support provinces and territories in the best way possible.
Our government is here to help.
We’ve made this funding flexible, so provinces, and ultimately schools, can use it for what they need most, from hand sanitizer to remote learning.
Over the next few weeks, we will work hand in hand with the provinces and territories to ensure that the funds flow as quickly as possible.
On top of this new funding, we’re also investing $112 million in schools in First Nations communities.
This money will help those communities safely open their schools with proper supports for students, parents, and educators.
I want to thank everyone who has helped bring this new Safe Return to Class Fund together.
Over the past week, I’ve heard clearly from MPs across the country, as well as directly from concerned parents, asking us to see just what the federal government can do to help keep our kids safe.
So, in his very first days as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Minister LeBlanc and I talked about this, and he reached out to folks across the country.  
And again, I want to thank members of caucus – including and especially Kirsty and Judy, here with us today – who have been a driving force to get more help to parents and kids.
Also, yesterday when I sat down with Dr. Tam, back to school was one of a number of things that we talked about to prepare for the fall.
Together, we came up with creative solutions for the Government of Canada to help our families and ensure our children are safe.
School safety is top of mind for all of us right now.
No matter where they live, students must be safe in their classrooms.
Teachers and staff must be safe on the job.
And parents must be confident that they can get back to work. 
At our First Ministers’ Meeting yesterday afternoon, the Premiers and I discussed the measures we’re taking to keep Canadians safe in the weeks and months to come.
That includes today’s federal support for schools, and progress on everything from personal protective equipment, to help for the most vulnerable.
I would like to thank the Premiers for working together on several important projects over the past few months.
Fighting COVID-19 is a Team Canada effort, and we’re all committed to continuing this work together into the fall.
Thanks to everyone for being here today.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-08-21,"Hello everyone.
It’s always great to be here with friends, particularly you, Premier Ford, but here as well with Minister Anand.
We’re also joined by provincial Ministers Clark and Fedeli, the president of 3M Canada Penny Wise, and of course, Mayor Baker of Brockville.      
Right from the start of this crisis, our government has worked closely with the provinces and territories to get Canadians the support they need.
Whether it’s hospital gowns, gloves, face shields, or masks, we’re working around the clock to help our essential workers.  
At the same time, we’ve invested in production here at home.
Earlier this summer, we announced a contract with General Motors to produce 10 million face masks at their plant in Oshawa, items that are already rolling off the line.
Not only does this create good, middle-class jobs, it also helps ensure that we have the capacity to make whatever we need here in our own communities.
And on that front, we have even more good news to share today.
Today, I can announce that the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario have reached an agreement with 3M Canada to expand their facility and make N95 masks right here in Brockville.
The federal government will support 3M’s capital investment by contributing just over $23 million, and the Government of Ontario is doing the same.
Once it’s up and running, this plant will deliver 25 million N95 masks each year to the federal government, and another 25 million to the province of Ontario.
As Minister Bains has said before, this is part of our made-in-Canada plan to find solutions to COVID-19.
This will keep our front line workers safe, and secure domestic PPE production for years to come.
We also want to make sure we have N95 masks available should we face another health crisis in the future.
This facility should be operational starting early next year.
Before we get to questions, I want to take a moment to once again thank Premier Ford for his collaboration on this project and on many other things.
Today’s announcement is yet another example of the important progress we can make by working together.
Right across the country, different orders of government have worked hand-in-hand with one shared goal: keeping Canadians safe and getting our economies rolling again.
And this announcement today is just another example of what we can do when we work together and focus on all Canadians.
Together, we are making the necessary investments to protect the lives of our front line workers in Ontario and across Canada.
We will continue to work with the provinces and territories to provide Canadians with the support they need in the coming weeks and months.       
Thank you very much.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-08-18,"Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you for joining us.
Yesterday, I accepted Bill Morneau’s resignation as Minister of Finance.
For almost five years, Bill has worked tirelessly on behalf of all Canadians to build a strong, resilient economy that works for everyone.
I want to thank Bill for his outstanding service as Minister of Finance and as the Member of Parliament for Toronto Centre.
No matter his next steps, I know he will continue to make important contributions to our country in the years to come. 
Earlier today, I was at Rideau Hall to make a few changes to our Cabinet.
Chrystia Freeland is now Canada’s Minister of Finance, and will remain Deputy Prime Minister.
Dominic LeBlanc is the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, and continues to serve as the President of the Queen’s Privy Council of Canada.  
In the weeks and months ahead, their work will be more important than ever.
Right now, the world is at a crossroads.
Canada is at a crossroads.
As economies relaunch, we’re seeing COVID-19 reappear in places like Australia and New Zealand.
It’s their winter right now, but ours is still ahead.
We have to be vigilant, because we have worked too hard and sacrificed too much to go backwards.
The fight is still far from over.
Just take the fact that some provinces are seeing new cases after weeks of declining numbers.
For parents especially, this is a big worry in terms of the school year.
I hear that.
And as a dad, I’m concerned about this too.
Provincial leaders have a responsibility to make sure that our kids are safe in their classrooms.
As federal government, we’ll do whatever we can to help, including through our $19 billion Safe Restart Agreement.
But of course, it’s not just school that are on people’s minds.
While many Canadians are back at work, the unemployment rate is still in double digits.
It’s tough for all Canadians, but we have to remember that it’s those who were already struggling who are hardest hit.
Women are facing impossible choices between their kids and career.
Racialized Canadians and Indigenous people are confronting extra barriers.
Young people are dealing with unexpected burdens as they worry about their future. 
It will take time to make up the economic ground we’ve lost to this pandemic.
It will take hard work to fix these gaps.
This pandemic has taught us some important lessons.
It has highlighted the inequalities that still exist and the vulnerabilities we have as a society.
But Canada is not alone.
Around the world, a consensus is emerging that the time has come to think boldly and rebuild even stronger.
Advanced economies understand that with very low interest rates, borrowing costs are also very low to help stimulate the recovery.
Countries like Canada that have a strong fiscal position must invest to help people get through this crisis.
Our G7 allies, whether it is Germany or the United Kingdom, or our partners like the European Union or South Korea, they all understand that this is a time to act.
And we must seize the opportunity as well.
We have a choice to make.
We can decide to move forward instead of returning to the status quo.
We can choose to embrace bold new solutions to the challenges we face, and refuse to be held back by old ways of thinking. 
As much as this pandemic is an unexpected challenge, it is also an unprecedented opportunity.
This is our chance to build a more resilient Canada: a Canada that is healthier and safer, greener and more competitive.
A Canada that is more welcoming and more fair. 
This is our moment to change the future for the better.
We can’t afford to miss it because this window of opportunity won’t be open for long.
We’ve supported Canadians with a huge emergency response to make sure that everyone could cope during this time.
We’ve carefully – and successfully – reopened many parts of the economy.
And now, we also need to look to the future.
We need long-term solutions that address the shortfalls in healthcare that meant soldiers were caring for seniors.
We need good, middle-class jobs that can withstand the challenges of tomorrow.
We need to get through this pandemic in a way that gives everyone a real and fair chance at success, not just the wealthiest 1 per cent.
In other words, we need a long-term plan for recovery.
A plan that addresses, head on, the fundamental gaps this pandemic has unmasked.
In the coming weeks, we will present our plan to rebuild a stronger, more resilient Canada.
This will be our roadmap out of the pandemic towards a society that is fairer and more welcoming.
Towards communities that are better prepared for future crises.
And towards a country where everyone is safer and healthier.
This is the same week that the House of Commons was already scheduled to return.
The Throne speech will give us the opportunity to lay out, in detail, our approach going forward.
It will also allow Parliament to hold a confidence vote on this new plan.
Today, I have asked the Governor General to prorogue Parliament, which must happen before any government can present a Throne speech.
Whether you’re counting on the CERB or EI while you look for work, or on the wage subsidy to keep employees on the job – these programs will not be affected by the prorogation.
In fact, starting a new session of Parliament is about creating sustainable ways to support you moving forward.
That has always been our number one focus and it always will be.
Eight months ago, our government introduced a plan to address the issues that matter most to Canadians.
This plan was designed for a different Canada, one before COVID.
Since then, our reality has changed, as has our approach.
Parliament must support a new agenda that responds to the new world in which we live.
Canadians expect us to work together at times like this.
We are ready to do our part, to get Parliament’s support for our plan for a more resilient Canada.
A plan that allows us to remain vigilant and keep the virus under control.
A plan that invests in Canadians.
A plan for a better future.
We have lots of work ahead of us in the weeks and months to come. 
And I know that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister LeBlanc – who have taken on new roles today – are the people we need for the job.
The whole team is ready for the path ahead. 
I’m looking forward to the challenges the coming months will bring.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-07-31,"Hello, everyone.
I am very happy to be here today with Minister Murray, Dr. Tam, and Parliamentary Secretary Vandenbeld.
Before I get started, let me wish Eid Mubarak to all Muslim Canadians celebrating today.
Although this year will be different than normal, I know that the values of charity and community will be as strong as ever.
Today, I want to talk about where we are on a number of important items—the spread of the virus and new tools to address it, support for farm workers and small businesses, and finally, the future of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.
Let me start with the spread of the virus.
In just the past week, we’ve seen COVID-19 cases rising in many communities.
Frankly, it’s a reminder that we can’t let down our guard.
Because that’s how you’ll keep yourself, and others, safe.
And to all the women and men working here at PHAC, and in teams right across the country—thank you for your outstanding service.
Since March, Canadians have been working around the clock to keep each other safe.
And together, we’ve come up with innovative solutions to meet an unprecedented challenge. 
A few weeks ago, I announced that our government was working with the Government of Ontario, BlackBerry, and Shopify volunteers on a new app to help slow the spread of this virus.
As of this morning, the COVID Alert app is ready to download through the App Store or the Google Play Store on your phone.
Right now, it’s connected to the Ontario health system, but we know other provinces will be joining in soon.
So people across the country can and should download it today.
This is another tool to protect your health.
Here’s how it works.
The app will let you know if you’ve been in contact with someone who has the app and has tested positive for COVID-19.
I want to be clear: this app isn’t mandatory—it’s completely voluntary to download and to use.
And it doesn’t collect your name, your address, your geolocation, or any other personal information.
I’ve downloaded the app this morning, and I encourage you to do the same.
The more people use it, the better it can trace and therefore slow the spread of the virus.
In fact, health experts say that if enough people sign up, this app can help prevent future outbreaks of COVID-19 in Canada.
I know that Premier Ford will have more to say about this first made-in-Ontario system, but I want to thank him for his partnership in getting this program up and running.
We’re working hard with our Atlantic provincial partners to integrate their health systems into the app next.
And at the same time, we’re in discussion with other provinces, and we expect that they’ll be coming onboard soon as well.
Since the start of the pandemic, our government has worked hard to keep Canadians safe, while getting people the support they need.
Of course, we know there’s still more to be done, so today, we’re taking yet another step forward.
This morning, I can announce that our government is investing almost $59 million to protect the health and safety of foreign workers on Canadian farms.
This will fund more farm inspections, provide emergency relief when needed, and improve the overall living conditions on farms.
We also know that help is needed right now in many locations.
Currently, thanks to the $100-million investment we announced in May, the Canadian Red Cross is helping the most at-risk workers in the Windsor-Essex region in particular.
Ministers Qualtrough, Bibeau, and Mendicino are also looking at ways to improve the Temporary Foreign Worker Program as a whole.
This includes measures like developing mandatory requirements for better living conditions for workers, so that we can continue to support and protect the people who keep food on our plates.
Whether you are a student or you are looking for a full-time job, there are a lot of opportunities right now in the agriculture and agri-food industry.
The people working in this sector are feeding our families and stocking our grocery shelves.
If this is of interest to you, I encourage you to visit agr.gc.ca to learn more about the “Step up to the plate” program.
I also want to talk a little about what we’re doing to support workers and businesses across the economy.
First of all, we know that, for a number of businesses, it’s not easy to pay rent after losing money for months.
In the spring, we introduced the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance, which helps reduce small businesses’ rent by 75 per cent.
Over 700,000 employees have benefitted from the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance—people who’ve been able to keep their jobs because of the help businesses got through this program.
We know there are even more people still to reach.
And that’s why we are officially extending the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program for the month of August. 
In the weeks ahead, we’ll have more details about what will come after the CERB.
But to people who need this program—don’t worry, no one will be left behind.
Because EI should cover every Canadian who’s looking for work.
And for those who don’t qualify for EI right now, like gig or contract workers, we will create a transitional, parallel benefit that is similar to Employment Insurance.
It will include access to training, and being able to work more hours and earn more money while receiving the benefit.
That’s only appropriate as our economy reopens and brings back more jobs.
There will also be a sickness and caregivers benefit for Canadians not covered at work if they get COVID-19, or if their kids or parents get it and they have to take care of them.
We’ll have more details to share before the end of August, but here’s the bottom line.
We intend to cover every Canadian who is looking for work with a better, 21st century EI system.
That is our goal.
And of course, there will be no increase to EI premiums during this challenging time.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-08,"Hello everyone.
Earlier today, we received the job report for April.
These numbers tell us what we already knew – that right now, Canadians are hurting because of this pandemic.
Everyone has their own story, but it all boils down to a very difficult time for a lot of people.
Canadians aren’t alone in this, as the world faces COVID-19.
But if you’re out of work, you don’t need to hear that other people are out of work, too.
You need to know that there’s a plan to get you through this, and get you back on the job.
And that’s exactly what this government is focused on.
In the face of this unprecedented challenge, we’ve taken action.
Maybe you’re one of the more than seven million people getting the CERB to help make ends meet.
Or better yet, maybe thanks to the wage subsidy, your employer has been able to rehire you.
That’s what happened for people who work at Pursuit, a Banff tourism company.
They’re back on the job because of this program.
We created the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to protect jobs wherever possible.
Since it launched last week, employers have applied for subsidies for almost two million workers.
And as provinces and territories start to gradually reopen over the coming months, and the CERB becomes less and less needed, this subsidy will play an even greater role.
That’s why I can announce today that we will be extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy beyond June to help kick-start our economic re-opening and boost jobs.
We’ll have more details next week, but to businesses hit by COVID-19, know this: the wage subsidy will continue to be there for you, to help you keep your employees on the payroll.
So fill out the application at Canada.ca if you haven’t already done so.
And if you had to let people go, try to bring them back.
It’s those workers who will drive our economy’s short- and long-term recovery.
Canadians want to work.
So we’re going to help them get back to work. 
On other support, the Canada Emergency Business Account has been accessed by well over half a million businesses to give them much-needed loans.
Between the CEBA and the wage subsidy, we’re helping employers across the country keep Canadians on the job.
Now, even though we’re reaching millions of Canadians, we need to reach even more.
We’re working around the clock to update and adjust, so that help gets to as many workers, small businesses, families, and young people as possible.
We also know that some sectors have been hit especially hard.
So we’re stepping up on that, too.
Minister Bains will be leading a new Industry Strategy Council.
Chaired by Monique Leroux, this Council will take a deeper dive into how the pandemic is affecting specific sectors, and how to best support them.
We are leveraging expertise from the Economic Strategy Tables we set up in the first mandate, as well as looking to new industry leaders.
This will be a dedicated forum for industry and government to come together on tackling the effects of COVID-19.  
And it builds on what we’ve already done for workers in everything from energy to agriculture.
On that note, Minister Guilbeault will have more details at noon about how our $500 million package for arts, culture, and amateur sport is now being rolled out to support workers in those sectors.
This investment will help people access wage support, and help organizations access funding.  
Our artists, creators, and young athletes inspire us, and help us feel connected even when we’re at home.
They’re there for us, and we’re going to be there for them.
No matter where you work, no matter who you are, these are tough times.
But with the right plan, we will get through this.
And we’ll come back stronger than ever.
It’s hard to think of tougher times for our country.
But as our elders remind us, Canada has faced challenges before.
And we’ve always overcome them.
Today, we mark the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, and the end of the Second World War on the continent.
After six years of war it must have felt like that day would never come.
But it did.
And it came because of the courage of all who served, and because of the sacrifice of all who gave their lives.
It has been 75 years since our grandparents and great-grandparents stood up to do their part.
75 years since they stood united and strong to ensure that we would live in peace and freedom.
Today, as our generation faces our own battle, let us be inspired by them and their valour as we protect them, and all Canadians.
This is our challenge, and I know we will rise to meet it.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on the measures in place to help Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/08/prime-ministers-remarks-measures-place-help-canadians-during-covid-19
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-07,"Hello everyone.
I want to begin with a few words about the terrible helicopter crash that claimed the lives of six Canadian Armed Forces members last week.
Yesterday, I attended a ceremony in their honour.
I was grateful to have an opportunity to pay my respects.
I got to speak with mothers, fathers and stepfathers, grandparents, friends, sons and daughters, fiancés, partners, and loved ones. All of them were heartbroken, but all of them were also immensely proud of the life of service chosen by their loved one, as are we all.
We will never forget their service. They will live on in our hearts and I know the thoughts of all Canadians are with the families and loved ones who are going through an incredibly difficult time. We stand with them and we will continue to stand with them.
This time and again, members of the Canadian Armed Forces step up to help those in need.
Whether it be as part of a NATO mission in Europe or in the wake of a natural disaster here in Canada – they’re always there for us. 
Eager to help. Ready to serve.
And this pandemic is no exception.
When our government received requests for assistance from Ontario and Quebec, our men and women in uniform once again answered the call.
In Ontario, 265 CAF members have now been deployed to five long-term care facilities.
They are supporting our frontline workers, caring for our parents and grandparents, and bringing some comfort to their families.
If you’ve lost a loved one in one of those facilities, or if you have a loved that you haven’t been able to visit for weeks, you’re worried sick about what tomorrow will bring and you hope that they’re getting the care they deserve.
Seeing our CAF members offer their help and talents during these uncertain times is a reassuring sight for many of these families.
Across the country, some 1,200 Canadian Rangers were deployed to help stem the spread of the virus in a number of regions, including 200 Rangers in Nunavik and the Lower North Shore.
Throughout Quebec, we now have more than 670 Canadian Armed Forces members at 20 provincial long-term care facilities, with another 350 members as back-up.
Next week, we expect a total of 1,350 military members who will have been assigned to this operation to assist at up to 25 facilities.
The provincial long-term care facilities and seniors’ residences have been the hardest hit by COVID‑19.
And our armed forces are there to lend a hand.
I would therefore like to take a moment to thank all our military members who are giving a hand at this time.
I also want to thank all the frontline workers who continue to work harder than ever to keep our seniors safe.
You are an inspiration to all of us.
You take care of our parents. You care of the sick. You take care of us.
You have led the offensive against COVID-19 since the start of this crisis and you deserve more than just our appreciation.
You deserve the proper pay for the essential work you perform.
Today I can announce that we have an agreement with all the provinces and territories to provide a wage top-up for essential workers.
For Canadians who are being called to go to work every day.
For Canadians who are providing us with essential services, so we can continue to keep our families safe and healthy.
Right now, we’re finalizing the details with the last provinces, and I want to underscore that this has been a truly collaborative effort.
Premiers from across the country all agree that we need to support our essential workers. And I thank the premiers for the continued Team Canada approach.
We’re relying on these workers now more than ever — and we will be there to support them.
It will be up to each province and territory to determine who exactly qualifies for this wage increase, but the bottom line is this.
If you’re risking your health to keep this country moving and you’re making minimum wage – you deserve a raise.
I want to close by noting that today, Buddhists in Canada and around the world will mark Vesak, their most important festival.
While this year’s celebrations will be a bit different, the Buddha’s message of peace, selfless service, and compassion to those in need is more important than ever.
I want to wish a happy and peaceful Vesak to all those celebrating.
",Prime Minister’s remarks announcing agreements to boost wages for essential workers,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/07/prime-ministers-remarks-announcing-agreements-boost-wages-essential
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-06,"Mr. Speaker,
Between the outbreak of war in September 1939, and the Allied Victory in Europe on May 8, 1945, more than one million Canadians served in our country’s armed forces.
More than 43,000 lives were lost.
In the liberation of the Netherlands, which we also commemorate this week, 7,600 Canadians perished, over the course of a brutal, eight-month campaign.
The scale of their generation’s sacrifice can be difficult to comprehend. For this was a time, Mr. Speaker, when the population of Canada was only 12 million people. Think about that.
Yet they shouldered this burden, and they carried it, without complaint, until the job was done, and they could come home and resume their lives. Those who were able to come home.
In so doing, they laid the foundation, not only for seven decades of post-war peace and prosperity, but for a new generation of immigrants from across the European continent – and in time, from around the world – who built new lives in Canada and who built Canada itself.  
For them, Canada represented peace and a place to escape from crisis and turmoil.
Then—and still now—Canada offered a promise of a better, more peaceful, and more prosperous future.
Mr. Speaker, can there really be a more enduring and poignant example of Canada's importance in the world?
The tens of thousands of patriotic men and women who enlisted to serve their country during the darkest days of the war, in the early 1940s, could not have known that the Allies would ultimately be victorious.
They could not have known that on a sunny day in May, long years later, Canadian soldiers would be greeted as heroes by throngs of overjoyed men, women, and children in the streets of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague. 
They knew only that they had a moral obligation to serve. One shared, Mr. Speaker, by the six brave Canadians who tragically lost their lives a week ago, while serving in Operation REASSURANCE.
Mr. Speaker, as we mark the Liberation of the Netherlands and Victory in Europe Day, we honour all these great Canadians.
We honour their toughness, their moral fibre, and their resolve, which changed the course of history.
We honour their sacrifice.
For the Canadians who went to the front lines and served in the Second World War not only defeated the forces of fascism, authoritarianism, and oppression.
They built a better world.
They built transatlantic alliances that protect us to this day and formed bonds that enhance our prosperity.
When Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands addressed this House in 2018, he spoke of the enduring friendship between our two countries. A friendship forged during the war through the extraordinary actions of ordinary Canadians.
Our soldiers liberated the cities from Nazi occupation and, to this day, the children who hailed them in the streets remember their courage and actions.
Seventy-five years later, they continue to tend to the graves of our fallen soldiers. Their children and grandchildren lay flowers at the feet of monuments dedicated to the memory of our Canadian heroes.
Mr. Speaker, it has been 75 years since our parents, our grandparents, and our great-grandparents, the Greatest Generation, stepped up to do their part to build a more prosperous, secure, and free world.
As our Minister of Veterans Affairs put it: “Many sacrificed their future to liberate people who had suffered for years under brutal occupation. They left behind family, friends, children, parents, and communities. People that loved them.”
My grandfather, Wilbur Freeland, and his two brothers, Carleton and Warren, were among those volunteers. Carleton and Wilbur came home. Warren did not.
Today, as our country faces a new battle, against a pandemic that knows no borders, I cannot think of a better example to follow. And, I cannot think of a better reason to serve. 
For the last surviving members of the Greatest Generation, our elders, are now the generation most in need of our protection, from the COVID-19 pandemic.
They look to us to do what is right, responsible, and just, Mr. Speaker – however hard that might be.  
They look to us to forgo, for now, the comforts and pleasures of gatherings and ordinary social interaction.
They look to us to follow the advice of public health professionals; to wash our hands; to avoid non-essential travel; and to stay home, as much as possible, for as long as necessary.
I actually think it is very simple, Mr. Speaker.
We owe it to the generation of Canadians who won that great Victory in Europe, and who built the peace that followed, to do whatever is in our power to keep them safe.
And we owe it to generations to come, our own children and grandchildren, to bequeath to them a country that is more prosperous, free, and secure than the one we, ourselves, inherited.
They did their part. Now, we must do ours.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
",Deputy Prime Minister remarks in the House of Commons on the 75th anniversary of the Liberation of the Netherlands and Victory in Europe Day,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/06/deputy-prime-minister-remarks-house-commons-75th-anniversary-liberation
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-05,"Hello everyone.
Before we get started, I want to note that today marks the 75th anniversary of the Liberation of the Netherlands.
On this day, we remember the Canadians and Newfoundlanders who liberated the Netherlands from the tyranny of the Nazis.
We also pay tribute to the deep bonds that were forged between Canada and the Netherlands.
We honour the incredible courage and sacrifice of our veterans in whom we are forever in their debt.
Time and time again, Canadians step up in periods of crisis to help each other and to help our friends.
We saw it 75 years ago on the battlefields of the Second World War and we’re seeing it once again during this pandemic.
These days, people in the food industry are working harder than ever to stock the shelves of our grocery stores.
They continue to work long hours to feed us, but the pandemic is making their job that much harder.
Workers need to take extra precautions to protect themselves. They need to change their ways and maintain physical distance.
And since hotels and restaurants are closed, many producers are left with large surpluses of certain products.
From the beginning, we said we were going to be there for those who need a hand.
So today, we are announcing a new investment of more than $252 million to help the agri-food sector get through this crisis.
Of that amount, we’re announcing more than $77 million to support food processors during this crisis.
This is money that they can use to purchase personal protective equipment for workers, adapt to health protocols, and support other social distancing measures.
It will also help expand or adapt our processing capacity to increase the amount of Canadian products we make domestically.
To help cattle and hog producers, we will launch national AgriRecovery initiatives of up to $125 million.
Farms and processing plants are raising more animals than the system can process into things like steak and bacon because of COVID-19.
For many farmers, this crisis means that they have to keep animals for longer periods of time – and that can be expensive.
So with this funding, we’re giving extra help to beef and pork producers so that they can adapt to this crisis.
This is an initial investment and if we need to add more, we will.
With respect to dairy farmers, we intend to work with all parties in the House to increase the Canadian Dairy Commission’s line of credit by $200 million.
The Commission already has a program in place to store and preserve dairy products.
It has been storing butter and cheese since the beginning of the crisis, and expects to reach its maximum capacity soon.
By increasing the Commission’s line of credit, we can prevent the loss of fresh Canadian products and help dairy producers deal with the consequences of the crisis.
With hotels and restaurants closed, too much of certain types of foods – like milk, butter, and potatoes – is being produced.
While some donations have been made to food banks, we don’t have the capacity right now to redistribute such large quantities of food.
And some producers have no choice but to throw out their product.
It’s a waste of food and a loss of revenue for the people who worked so hard to produce it.
To avoid this, we’re launching a Surplus Food Purchase Program, starting with a $50 million fund.
The government will buy large quantities of certain products at risk of going to waste, like say, potatoes or poultry, and redistribute them to organizations addressing food insecurity.
This will help ensure that our farmers are being compensated for their hard work, and that our most vulnerable have access to fresh food during this crisis.
Taken together, these measures represent a $252 million investment to support the people who keep our grocery stores stocked and our families fed.
I also want to take a moment to underscore the work that’s been done by Minister Bibeau on this file.
That said, we know that farmers still have concerns about what this pandemic means for their industry long-term.
Having enough workers for harvesting later in the season, having enough personal protective equipment for workers – these are valid concerns.
And I can assure you that we are working with farmers, stakeholders, and provinces and territories to find lasting solutions.
I want to close today by thanking every person who works in our food industry.
People are spending a lot more time in the kitchen, cooking for an elderly neighbour, cooking for themselves, discovering new recipes, or trying to make sourdough.
These days especially, cooking and baking is about more than nourishment.
It’s also about relieving stress, finding a community, supporting each other, creating memories.
You help make that possible.
So we’re here for all of you and the agri-food industry – and we will continue to be here for you.
Thank you for everything you’re doing for us.
Thank you very much.
",Prime Minister’s remarks announcing additional support for the agricultural sector,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/05/prime-ministers-remarks-announcing-additional-support-agricultural-sector
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-04,"Hello everyone.
In the fight against COVID-19, our focus will always be here at home.
But this is a global challenge.
To keep Canadians safe and restart our economy, we need to defeat this virus not just within our borders, but wherever it will be found.
That’s how we’ll beat COVID-19 for good.
So just like we’re coordinating our efforts across the country, we’re collaborating with allies around the globe, too.
Earlier this morning, I joined leaders from other countries, and from civil society and industry, to work together on accelerating the global development of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, and testing.
We all share a common goal: ending this pandemic.
And Canada is stepping up to do its part.
Canada’s contribution of over $850 million, in Canadian dollars, for the global fight against COVID-19 includes investments in Canadian and international research.
At home, we’re providing funding for everything from the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization for their work on a vaccine development, to Vancouver-based AbCellera for treatments.
Right across the country, we’re making sure that Canadians can keep leading.
Our $850 million commitment also includes support for vaccine development through the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the WHO’s Solidarity Trial that helps hospitals share information on treatments.
The more we cooperate, the more likely that we find a cure, and find it quickly.
And that’s something we all want to see.
COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge.
But it’s not the first time that Canadians have been called to do their part.
Over the past generations, Canadians have time and time again stepped up in defense of our shared future.
From the fall of 1944 to the spring of ‘45, thousands of Canadians pushed back the occupying forces, road by road, town by town.
They fought and many died to defend the values that we hold dear – peace and democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.
And today, 75 years later, we remember their courage and their sacrifice.
Earlier this morning, I spoke with Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands.
We talked about the close, lasting bond of friendship that exist between our two countries.
We talked about how we collaborated together in years past, standing for our values, fighting side by side, and how we are doing that again today in this global crisis – in friendship and in solidarity.  
So today, I ask all Canadians to join me and our friends and allies in the Netherlands at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time to observe two minutes of silence in honour of our veterans.
As we pause, let’s reflect on how each of us can live up to their example.
Maybe you’ll do your part by staying home to protect our health care workers.
Maybe you’ll bring groceries to an elderly neighbour, or make a donation to a food bank, or simply make the effort of sending a postcard to a veteran to thank them for their service.
Everyone can play a part in helping their community.
With your actions, you are contributing to your community and demonstrating that Canadians, time and time again, will continue to step up.
I know the weather is getting nicer, but we still need to be extremely careful.
And not just for our seniors, but for everyone around us.
So don’t go out unless you absolutely have to.
And if you do, keep two metres apart from each other.
Thank you very much.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-03,"Hello everyone.
As we remember the sailors, soldiers, and pilots who helped turn the tide of the Second World War, we honour all our veterans who stepped forward so we may live in peace.
We think of the brave men and women who serve today, and we mourn the six heroes we lost just last week.
To their loved ones, to those serving on HMCS Fredericton, and to all CAF members – I want to once again offer the deepest condolences of all Canadians.
Over the last four months, Canada has faced challenge and heartbreak on a scale we could never have expected.
So if you’re feeling overwhelmed – that’s understandable.
If you need support – that’s ok.
In April, we launched Wellness Together Canada, a website where you can find people to talk to if you’re in crisis.
And today, we’re taking another step forward.
Our government is investing over $240 million to bring health care online.
We’re expanding existing online tools, creating new virtual platforms for mental health and for primary care.
Let me start with the new platform for mental health.
Whether you’re looking for strategies to manage stress, or support from a professional, this will be a resource for you.
And if you’re part of a marginalized community and you need specialized tools, well, there’ll be specific help for you as well.
If we can provide mental health support online, there’s no reason we can’t leverage technology in other areas of health care, too.
This $240 million investment will also include funding for virtual care, for times when you don’t need to see a doctor in person.  
Just take videoconferencing.
By helping doctors run appointments online, you can stay safe at home while getting care, and our hospitals can stay focused on those who need it most.
And since we’re all practicing physical distancing these days, now is the time to invest in these solutions.
If we can use apps to order dinner and videochats to stay in touch with family, we can use new technology to keep each other healthy.
To beat COVID-19, we have to think outside the box.
When Canadian researchers have a solid lead, we need to make sure they can follow it up.
That’s exactly what we’ve been doing over the last two months, and we’re starting to see real results.
Today, I can announce that we are investing over $175 million to support the Canadian company AbCellera for their very promising COVID-19 research.
They’ve identified antibodies that could be used in drugs to treat this virus.
This new funding will help them continue their vital work, and will support human trials beginning as early as July.  
But until we have effective treatments, or better yet a vaccine, we still need a reliable supply of everything from masks to ventilators.
So later today, Minister Anand will announce the details of a new COVID-19 Supply Council.
This council will be tasked with finding innovative solutions to ensure our country continues to have the vital supplies necessary to keep Canadians safe.
I want to end today, as I do most Sundays, talking to families.
To parents – I know this is a tough time right now to be raising kids.
Right now, you should be able to focus on keeping your family safe, not worrying about the bills.
So this May, you’ll get more help through the Canada Child Benefit.
When you receive this month’s payment, you’ll see an extra $300 per child.
For families with two kids that means an extra $600, for three kids an extra $900, and so on.
This is money for whatever you need, whether it’s online tutoring or groceries.
It’s tough for families these days.
So we’re giving parents a hand so as to make things easier for them.
And to all the kids out there – I know things are hard for you, too.
I know you miss your friends, and it’s not always easy to do your schoolwork online.
You want to be outside and to go play in the park.
But this isn’t going to last forever so keep planning fun things to do with your friends once this is over, keep up on your homework, and remember – we’re going to get through this together, so thanks for all your help around the house, with your parents, and sticking together through this difficult time.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-01,"Good morning everyone.
Before we get started, I want to take a moment to note the appointment of Tiff Macklem as the next Governor of the Bank of Canada.
Mr. Macklem, who is currently the Dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, has extensive experience in the global financial system and risk management.
With his appointment, the Bank of Canada will be well positioned to help with the economic response, and eventual recovery, from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unfortunately, we have seen a rise in anti-Asian sentiment lately and this week, two more anti-Semitic incidents took place.
It’s important to celebrate who we are at all times, and not give in to hatred and fear.
When times are tough, Canadians come together – that is who we are.
On December 6, 1989, I was in Montreal, at the CEGEP just down the hill from the École Polytechnique.
I can’t tell you what I was studying that day.
But I will never forget the moment I heard the first news reports of a massacre at the École Polytechnique.
I was in complete shock at first. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.
As a 17-year-old, I could not understand how such an act of violence against women could happen in a country like ours. In a society like ours.
Every Canadian has their version of this story.
Every one of us remembers the day when we realized that, even in Canada, a man with a gun could irrevocably alter our lives for the worse.
We remember how our sense of safety was shaken. How our world view was changed. 
École Polytechnique. Mayerthorpe. Dawson College.
Moncton. La Loche. La grande mosquée de Québec.
The Danforth. Fredericton.
And Cumberland, Colchester, and Hants Counties, Nova Scotia.
These tragedies reverberate still.
They shape our identity. They stain our conscience.
They make adults out of children.
And the heartbreaking truth is they are happening more often than they once did.
With each passing year, more families are ripped apart by tragedy.
More parents are struggling to explain the inexplicable to their kids.
And more teenagers are growing up in a world where gun violence is normalized.
It needs to stop.
Last week, 22 Canadians were killed in the deadliest rampage in our country’s history.
They were nurses and teachers. Correctional officers and an RCMP officer.
They were someone’s child. Someone’s best friend. Someone’s partner.
Their families deserve more than thoughts and prayers.
Canadians deserve more than thoughts and prayers.
In the last election, we made a commitment to ban military-style assault rifles and implement a buy-back program.
We announced our intention to work with the provincial and territorial governments to allow municipalities to ban handguns.
We also promised to take other measures to save lives.
In October, Canadians entrusted their elected representatives with a clear mandate: to strengthen gun control in Canada.
And today, we are keeping our promise.
Today, we are closing the market for military-grade, assault weapons in Canada.
We are banning 1,500 models and variants of these firearms by way of regulations.
These weapons were designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time.
There is no use – and no place – for such weapons in Canada.
For many families, including many Indigenous people, firearms are part of traditions passed down through generations.
And the vast majority of gun owners use them safely, responsibly and in accordance with the law – whether it be for work, sport-shooting, for collecting or for hunting.
But you don’t need an AR-15 to bring down a deer.
So, effective immediately, it is no longer permitted to buy, sell, transport, import or use military-grade, assault weapons in this country.
To protect law-abiding gun owners from criminal liability until they can take steps to comply with this new law, there will be a two-year amnesty period and we will legislate fair compensation.
Now, I want to take a moment to recognize the leadership of Minister Blair on this file.
Tackling gun violence has been a personal and professional priority of his for decades. He’s done incredible work to make this policy a reality.
And we are here today thanks to his leadership and to the leadership of people like him. Thank you Bill.
30 years from now, an entire generation of Canadians will remember exactly where they were on Sunday, April 19, 2020.
They will remember how their sense of safety was shaken. How their outlook on the world was forever changed. 
They will remember the day that they lost some of their innocence. 
This chapter in our history cannot be rewritten. 
But what happens next is up to us.
We can stick to thoughts and prayers alone.
Or we can unite as a country and put an end to this.
We can decide, together, that enough is enough.
Today’s announcement builds on the things we did during our first term. It’s the next step.
And there is more work ahead to implement this and pass legislation to further strengthen our laws.
I’ve already spoken with the other parliamentary leaders and I know that we will be able to work together and do even more to keep Canadians safe.
Every single Canadian wants to see less gun violence and safer communities.
So today, we take another big step forward.
Thank you very much.
",Prime Minister’s remarks announcing a ban on assault-style firearms in Canada,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/05/01/prime-ministers-remarks-announcing-ban-assault-style-firearms-canada
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-05-01,"Good morning.
I grew up on a farm in northern Alberta. We had guns on our farm and we still do. As on many farms across our country.
If there were bears around, my dad would keep a gun in his truck.
And sometimes he'd hunt prairie chickens on his way home for supper.
And you know what? Neither my dad, nor any other farmer I knew then, or have known since, owned an assault rifle or an assault-style rifle.
That's because those weapons are not for hunting. They aren't for shooting a prairie chicken or scaring off a bear.
They're designed for only one purpose. To kill people and to look like they can kill people.
And when we reflect on the massacre of 14 women at the École Polytechnique in 1989; or the Dawson college shooting in 2006; or the horrible tragedy in Portapique, Nova Scotia just twelve days ago. Those heinous acts strengthen our resolve.
And that resolve is to close the gaps in our gun control laws, and to keep the most dangerous firearms out of civilian hands.
We neither need, nor want, such weapons in our homes, in our pickups, in our communities, or on our streets.
These guns make it easier to commit mass murder. And the culture around their fetishization makes our country inherently more dangerous for the people most vulnerable – and that is women and girls.
Every woman and girl listening today remembers a time when she was made to feel unsafe, vulnerable, or in harm's way. We all know what that's like. It's unacceptable that in 2020, gender continues to be a determining factor in whether you feel safe in your home or on your street.
During this pandemic, we are particularly concerned about the rise in gender-based and domestic violence. Front line organizations have seen a surge in appeals from women and children fleeing violence. British Columbia's Battered Women’s Support Services has received 300 per cent more calls since the beginning of the pandemic, and a Toronto-based shelter has seen a 400 per cent increase in demand for shelter.
And unfortunately, this isn't new.
From 2010 to 2015, according to statistics compiled by the Canadian Domestic Homicide Prevention Initiative, there were 418 cases of domestic homicide in Canada with 476 victims. Of the 427 adult victims, 79 per cent were women. Let that number sink in.
In 2019, according to the Canadian Femicide Observatory For Justice and Accountability, 118 women and girls died violently in Canada. On average, one every three days. Again, let that number sink in.
We all know the availability of assault-style weapons puts vulnerable populations, women, queer and trans people, Indigenous peoples, and people of colour at particular risk. The missing and murdered indigenous women, girls, and two-spirited people are, for me, one of the starkest and most tragic examples of systemic violence in our society.
Tackling systemic violence is our collective responsibility – one that requires us to challenge our attitudes, strengthen community support, ensure accountability for perpetrators, and, critically, keep deadly weapons out of their hands.
Femicide has long been a scourge in our society. It remains a scourge, and we must stop it.
In saying “no” to assault-style weapons, we are putting feminist ideas in to practice. We are acting to ensure that our sisters, our mothers, our grandmothers, our daughters, and ourselves, indeed that all women who have been victimized, frightened, threatened, harmed, brutalized, and killed by gun violence, have not suffered in vain.
Enough is enough.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-30,"Hello everyone.
Yesterday, a Canadian Armed Forces helicopter on a NATO mission, carrying six members of the Canadian Armed Forces, went down with all hands in the Ionian Sea, off the coast of Greece.
They were flying from the Canadian naval frigate HMCS Fredericton, home port of Halifax, as part of Operation REASSURANCE. 
One casualty was recovered and five are missing.
All of them are heroes.
Each of them will leave a void that cannot be filled.
On behalf of all Canadians, I want to offer my deepest support to their families, their friends, their shipmates, and their fellow CAF members.
Our hearts are with you.
This is another very hard day for Halifax, for Nova Scotia, and for our armed forces families.
I spoke to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg earlier this morning, who offers support and assistance in the times to come.
In the coming days, there will be many questions about how this tragedy occurred.
And I can assure you, we will get answers, in due course.
In a season of grief—a time of hardship, heartbreak and loss for so many Canadians—the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces stand tall.
Bearing the Maple Leaf on their shoulders, they are known around the world as beacons of civility, compassion, and courage.
Whether combatting terrorism, standing by our partners and allies, or supporting peace operations around the world, they do what they always do—step towards danger, so the rest of us can stay safe.
Operation REASSURANCE is Canada at its best—bolstering security and stability in Central and Eastern Europe.
Here at home, we turn to the forces in times of flood, fire, or other natural disasters.
They never say no.
They always put their shoulders to the wheel.
And now, as we battle the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian Armed Forces are on the front lines, in our seniors’ homes—helping to protect and care for our most vulnerable citizens.
Even as up to 915 soldiers are deployed on Operation REASSURANCE in Europe, reinforcing NATO’s collective defence, the CAF will soon have more than 500 serving in 13 long-term care facilities, in and around Montreal.
And more will go in, as they are prepared for this work.
Earlier this week CAF teams were deployed to assist in five long-term care facilities in Ontario.
These people are working day and night, helping to protect our parents, our aunts, our uncles, and our grandparents, and they deserve our gratitude.
Whether at home or abroad, the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces are the hand of our intentions—the concrete expression of our valour and values as Canadians.
And so we stand with them and we hold out hope to find the missing.
Once again, thank you for joining us.
I will now turn it over to Minister Sajjan, General Vance, and Deputy Minister Thomas

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-29,"Hello everyone.
Students are usually eager for May to come.
Classes have ended, and you only have a couple of exams left. You’re looking forward to starting your summer job and spending more time with your friends.
But not this year.
The pandemic is creating a lot of uncertainty and instability for everyone, including young people.
Students who are about to graduate could not take advantage of their last semester as they had hoped.
And now, they’re having trouble entering the labour market.
Students who are still in school face similar hurdles. Work placements have been cancelled and summer jobs have become exceedingly rare.
Many of you are wondering not just what you’re going to do for the next few months, but how you’ll pay your tuition next year.
So, last week, we unveiled a $9 billion plan to help you get through this crisis.
First, we announced the Canada Emergency Student Benefit, which will give students $1,250 a month throughout the summer.
And if you have a disability or are taking care of a dependent, you’ll receive more.
At the same time, we are investing to create an additional 76,000 jobs for students in sectors that need help or are actively contributing to the fight against COVID-19.
These jobs are in addition to those offered under the Canada Summer Jobs program.
If you can’t find a job this summer, but want to contribute in the fight against COVID-19, we’re going to make sure you have support, too.
Students helping in the fight against COVID-19 this summer will soon be eligible for $1,000 to $5,000 through the new Canada Student Service Grant for volunteer hours.
We’re also going to be providing specific support for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation students.
For graduate students and those conducting research, we’re going to extend scholarships, fellowships, and grants so your work can continue.
And, we’re doubling student grants for low and middle income students for 2020/2021.
Taken together, our government has a $9 billion plan to help students and recent grads get through the next few months.
Since we introduced this plan, we’ve been working with the opposition parties on legislation that will get this help to young people as quickly as possible.
I’ll be heading to Parliament shortly, where we will introduce a bill to put the Canada Emergency Student Benefit in place.
The pandemic has been hard on everyone and that’s why our government is stepping up to support you.
When schools closed, parents became teachers, restaurant owners, music teachers, and so much more.
Isolation has been hard on families, and that is why we are boosting the CCB. 
And to help lower income Canadians, we supplemented the GST Credit.
I also want to remind everyone that this year, if you owe income tax, you have until August to make your payment.
Yesterday, Minister Hajdu and Dr. Tam provided an update on our latest modelling.
And the good news is that Canadians are stepping up to keep each other safe.
In fact, in many parts of the country, the curve has flattened, so we have to keep it up.
We’re seeing some progress because people from coast to coast to coast are making sacrifices and following public health rules.
So let’s stick to it.
Let’s stay home, wash our hands, and when we go out, let’s stay two metres away from others.
Starting this weekend in Nova Scotia, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds will head across Canada to salute Canadians doing their part to stop the spread of COVID-19.
As we watch the Snowbirds fly over our homes, let’s remember that we are all in this together.
",Prime Minister’s remarks updating Canadians on the measures taken in response to COVID-19,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/04/29/prime-ministers-remarks-updating-canadians-measures-taken-response-covid
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-28,"Good morning, everyone.
I know many of you have seen reports about my mum.
I want to let you know that I’ve spoken with her and she’s doing just fine.
I’m thankful to everyone who has reached out, and want to also thank the first responders who were there doing an extraordinary job.
This morning, our thoughts go out to those of you who live in Fort McMurray as you deal with spring flooding.
Minister Blair has spoken with Mayor Scott about the situation, and we stand ready to help. 
To all the first responders and volunteers out there placing sandbags, including around the hospital – thank you.
Across the country, there are other communities dealing with flooding right now, too.
So to everyone – continue listening to officials as they work to keep you and your family safe.
This comes during what’s already a tough time but I know Canadians will continue to work together.
Shortly, I’ll join Members of Parliament from across the country for a virtual meeting of the House of Commons.
Despite the challenges of this pandemic, our democratic institutions are innovating and finding ways to keep serving people.
Parliamentarians are working together with the same goal: supporting Canadians and keeping our country strong.
As part of this sitting, at noon, Minister Hajdu will provide an update on the new COVID-19 modelling.
And Dr. Tam will also do the same.
Based on the best data available, this is an updated picture of where we think we are right now, and where we think things will go from here.
They’ll provide more details but here’s the bottom line.  
The measures we have taken so far are working.
In fact, in many parts of the country, the curve has flattened.  
But we’re not out of the woods yet.
We are in the middle of the most serious public health emergency Canada has ever seen, and if we lift measures too quickly, we might lose the progress we’ve made.
So we all need to be very careful, for ourselves and especially for the most vulnerable, like our parents, grandparents, and elders in long-term care facilities.
Earlier this month when we released the first modelling, I said that the path ahead was up to us.
And the same holds true today.
How many new cases there are, how many losses we have to mourn, whether our hospitals can continue to cope – it’s all up to all of us.
The good news is that people are doing the right things to protect each other.
But we have to keep it up.
Keep staying at home.
Go grocery shopping only once a week or less.
Stay two metres away from others.
And follow public health guidelines.
You’ve already stepped up to help your family, friends, neighbours, and front line care workers stay safe.
And your governments across the country are stepping up as well.
We are a big country and we don’t always agree on everything.
But right now, the premiers and the federal government are working together to fight this crisis.
We need common guidelines to make sure that the decisions being taken across the country are grounded in a shared understanding and appreciation of what science and experts are telling us.
Shortly, we will be releasing the shared principles on restarting the economy, agreed to by the federal, provincial, and territorial governments.
Let me be clear: these are not the specific measures when you can go back to work or school or when you can see your neighbours or extended family or friends.
This framework will lay out the things that need to happen before we take any next steps.
Restarting our economy will be gradual and careful, and will be guided by science.
Here’s what the guidelines mean for you.
Controlling transmission is key.
You already know that if your neighbourhood doesn’t have new cases, if your province is flattening the curve – this is a good sign for being able to look at slowly lifting some restrictions.
So we need to know where things stand.
To reopen the economy, there must be enough capacity to test and trace COVID-19 to control any new spread.
For you, that means knowing that you’ll be safe at work when you go back.
You’ll see lots more testing, and if someone around you does test positive, you’ll be notified quickly, so you can isolate.
At work, there will also need to be specific measures and more equipment to keep you safe.
And for hospitals, we need to make sure they can continue to cope, not just for COVID-19 patients, but for everyone who needs care.
And for certain groups who are very vulnerable, like seniors and those in long-term care facilities, strong measures will have to be in place for longer.
The virus is taking a different toll on different people.
We must be mindful of that.
Whether you’re facing domestic violence, are living in a remote community or a long-term care facility or working on the front lines – we’re here for you.
Our priority is keeping all Canadians safe, while getting back to normal as much as we can.
Today, I also want to provide an update on personal protective equipment, which, along with physical distancing, is key to keeping people safe.
Every few days, we receive new deliveries of vital supplies for our front line workers.
This week, we will be shipping over six million surgical masks to the provinces and territories.
More than 100,000 face shields that we ordered from Bauer and Toronto Stamp are also ready, and will be shipped out soon with more on the way.
Everyone deserves to be safe on the job.
Indeed, on this National Day of Mourning, we remember those who died, were injured, or fell ill because of their work.
And this year, we pay tribute to the thousands of front line workers across the country who deserve not just our thanks, but our support.
I also want to remind everyone that businesses that need the emergency wage subsidy can now apply.
Over 44,000 businesses have applied online since yesterday.
To get through this, we must work together, and we must stay united. Now more than ever, we have to stand up against discrimination and division
There is no place for racism against Asian Canadians in our neighbourhoods. There is no place for antisemitism, which B’nai Brith Canada’s report found to be on the rise, in our communities.
Because hatred of any sort has no place in Canada.
Today, and every day, we are stronger together.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-27,"Hello everyone.
From coast to coast to coast, there are Canadians working long hours to keep each other safe and keep our country moving. 
But for everyone putting in an extra shift right now – there’s someone else who wants to work but can’t. Maybe you’ve been laid off because of the pandemic. Maybe you still have a job, but aren’t sure if your employer is going to keep you around next month.
Whatever your situation may be, we’re in your corner.
Earlier this month, we introduced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to help protect your job, or help you get back to work.
Employers can now submit a claim for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy through the Canada Revenue Agency.
To access the 75 per cent wage subsidy for your employees, go online through Canada.ca to reach this portal.
Whether you’re a charity that employs 200 people, or a fast-growing start-up that employs just 20 – you will be eligible to up to $847 per week per employee.
And you can expect to see this money soon.
The CRA has partnered with financial institutions, so make sure you register for direct deposit to get your money quickly.
For organizations like Focus on Nature, who sent me a letter last week, that’s huge.
Because of COVID-19, this charity from Guelph would have been forced to lay off all of their staff.
But thanks to the wage subsidy, they can now keep their employees on the payroll, and keep teaching kids about nature.
And there are so many more stories just like this one.
There have been over 300,000 views of the online calculator we launched last week to help businesses prepare a claim.
And since the portal opened at 6:00 a.m. this morning, almost 10,000 businesses have already applied for it.
That gives you a sense of just how many people this program will help.
Right across the country, it’s going to keep businesses and workers connected.
And that gives people certainty that they’ll have a job now, and in the months to come, to support themselves and their family and it means employers will not just have the help to stay afloat through the tough time, but they’ll be ready to gear back up when things get better.
We all know a local salon or a gym that’s had to close, a neighbourhood restaurant or shop that’s really struggling.
And more importantly, we all know people who work there.
They deserve a hand to get through this.
And that’s what the wage subsidy is for.
People are facing different challenges right now, and no single program can reach everyone.
So we’re coming at this from every angle.
If your employer can’t hire you back, if you’re a seasonal worker, if you can’t find a job right now – the Canada Emergency Response Benefit is there for you.
You’ve probably already received your first cheque.
And if you need the help again for the coming month, go online and re-confirm that you’re still eligible.
I want to remind everyone – you won’t be able to keep both the wage subsidy and the CERB.
It’s one or the other, not both.
If you’re a student, there’s support for you, too.
Right now, we’re working with the other parties on legislation to get this help flowing.
Parliament will have its first virtual sitting tomorrow, and an in-person sitting on Wednesday.
And if you’re an essential worker, you deserve to be paid properly for your incredible work.
Our government is doing its part to make that happen.
Ontario came out with their plan over the weekend, and we’re working with them to provide the support they need to deliver results.
And we’re currently in discussion with all the other provinces and territories to get their plans for essential workers in place.
I’ll have more updates for across the country in the coming days.
As I said Saturday, we’re also collaborating on shared guidelines for re-opening the economy, once the time comes.
Different provinces and territories will be able to move at a different pace.
But we need clear, coordinated efforts from coast to coast to coast.
And no matter where you live, you need to continue following the recommendations from public health officials that will keep everyone safe.
Stay at home.
Keep washing your hands frequently.  
And if you have to go out, stay two metres apart.  
Every day, we get closer to the time when we can put all of this behind us.
We get closer to the time when we can all celebrate together. But we’re not there yet.
Let’s persevere together, my friends.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-25,"Hello everyone. Happy Saturday.
Before we get started today, I wanted to thank the organizers of yesterday’s vigil for the victims of the Nova Scotia shooting.
The pandemic may have prevented us from gathering in person, but we still found a way to come together to celebrate the lives of the victims and support their families. 
It was an extremely moving tribute, and it was just yet another example of how Canadians are there for each other in difficult times.
Once again, my thoughts and the thoughts of all Canadians are with the families and loved ones of the victims.
This week, our government announced more targeted support for Canadians who are going through an especially hard time because of COVID‑19.
With the Emergency Community Support Fund, we’re giving more resources to charities and non-profits so that they can continue their important work.
We also unveiled our $9-billion plan to help students and recent grads get through the next few months.
Because of COVID-19, there aren’t as many jobs for students as last year.
And without a job, it can be hard to pay for tuition or the day-to-day basics.
So, we launched the Canada Emergency Student Benefit, which gives students at least $1,250 a month from May to August.
At the same time, we’re creating 76,000 jobs for young people in sectors that need an extra hand right now or on the front line of the pandemic.
And if students prefer to volunteer and help in the fight against COVID-19, they’ll be eligible for a $1,000 to $5,000 grant through the new Canada Student Service Grant.
For small companies, we announced yesterday that we had reached agreements with all the provinces and territories to decrease their rent by 75 per cent for the months of April, May, and June.  
I would also like to take this opportunity to remind employers of all sizes that they will be able to start applying for the emergency wage subsidy on Monday.  
In the meantime, you can visit the Canada Revenue Agency’s website to calculate what the subsidy will cover.
Our government is providing assistance to meet the immediate and urgent needs of workers and businesses.
At the same time, we are also thinking about what lies ahead for us over the next few months.
We are providing more funding for medical research into COVID-19 and the development of vaccines.
This week, we created the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, which will be responsible for tracing infections and gaining a better understanding of how we can immunize ourselves against the virus.
From the very beginning of the outbreak, our objectives as a government have been clear.
Help those who need it most.
Protect jobs.
Support the small businesses that make our communities better places to call home.
And lay the groundwork for our economy to come roaring back once this crisis is over.
In the past few weeks, our government introduced a series of measures to do just that, but we know there are more people to help. More work to be done.
So today, we’re announcing $62.5 million to support fish and seafood processors through this crisis.
As we fight COVID-19, people who work in fish and seafood processing plants across the country are playing a crucial role when it comes to getting food to our tables.
This funding will help ensure that they can safely continue their important work.
We’re giving more money to processors so that they can purchase personal protective equipment for workers, adapt to health protocols, and support other social distancing measures.
For example, fish processing plants could buy new equipment, like freezers or storage space, so that their product – food for Canadians – can stay good while they respond to a changing market.
With this announcement, we’re giving fish and seafood processors more resources to adapt to the many challenges brought on by the pandemic and, above all, keep workers safe.
Our fish sector is interconnected, so these investments will also have a positive impact on fish harvesters.
On that note, I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous work that is being done by every person who makes Canada’s food system possible, including our food producers and fish harvesters.
You keep our grocery stores stocked and our families fed.
I know that the past few weeks have been really tough on you too – whether it be financially or emotionally.
I want to thank you all for everything you do for us.
You’re providing an essential service to the country.
We know that you have specific needs and asks right now, and we are actively exploring additional ways to support you as we move forward.
Yesterday, I had a call with the First Ministers and we talked about putting together a joint statement outlining what needs to be done to re-open the economy.
We’re working together with Canada’s chief medical officers to establish principles and guidelines for us all.
We have to be mindful that the economy and the realities of each province and territory are unique, so the timing and specific measures will be different across jurisdictions.
We need a coordinated approach nationally to avoid any confusion amongst Canadians.
We’re working together on a plan based on science, data, and expert advice that lays out our common ambition to see our country through this.
The next phase will be crucial.  
If we don’t get the next phase right, we risk losing all the progress we’ve made so far.
These conversations are ongoing and we will keep working together for all Canadians.
Tomorrow, there won’t be any press conferences either by doctors or myself, so I want to close this morning by talking to young Canadians as I do every weekend.
To all the kids watching out there – you’re doing great.
Keep helping out around the house.
Try to keep up with your schoolwork.
And above all, stay positive.
This is a tough time but we’re going to get through this together.
And to young people out there – many of you are students who need extra help and we’re here for you.
This week, we announced a series of measures to support you during this crisis.
But we need your help too.
This is a moment in our country’s history that we will look back on and ask each of ourselves what we did for our community. For our country.
What did we do to serve our country? To help the world?
And as you look at what you can do this summer, please remember that there are seniors who need your help.
There are front-line workers, including in our medical professions, who could use a helping hand.
And there are agricultural farmers and producers who’d love to see you step up to help feed Canadians.
Look at how you can use your energy, your drive, your vision for making the world a better place, and make it so.
How we get through this as a country depends on each of us. The choices we make, the actions we take.
So this weekend, stay home.
Keep washing your hands.
And if you need to go out for groceries, keep at least two meters apart from each other.
And think about what you can do in the fight against COVID-19 to support our front-line workers, to help your community.
I know we will help each other to get through this, because that’s just who we are as Canadians.
Thank you very much. Have a great weekend.

This has been a heartbreaking week for Nova Scotians and for all Canadians.
At 2:00 p.m. Atlantic time, we will observe a minute of silence in honour of Constable Heidi Stevenson and all the victims of the Nova Scotia shooting.
I also want to remind everyone that at 7:00 p.m. Atlantic time or 6:00 p.m. Eastern time, a virtual vigil will be held to remember those who were taken from us too soon and support their friends and family during this particularly difficult time.
I hope that many of you will join us and wear red today in a show of solidarity.

Let’s celebrate the lives of those who left us too soon. Let us remember the families, friends, loved ones whose absence will linger for years and lives.
You can find more information at novascotiaremembers.com
Since the beginning of the outbreak, our government has been working with its provincial and territorial partners not only to get through this crisis, but to position our economy to rebound once it’s over.
And a big part of this work means listening to the concerns of Canadians and making adjustments as we go along.
One thing we’ve heard is that small businesses are having trouble making rent because of COVID-19.
If you’ve had to close up shop because of public health recommendations, if you don’t have a lot of money coming in because people aren’t spending as much these days – you may be worried about losing your office space or not having a coffee shop to reopen after this crisis.
So last week, we said that we’re planning on introducing the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance.
And today I can announce that we’ve reached agreements with all provinces and territories to lower rent by 75 per cent for small businesses that have been strongly affected by COVID-19 for April, May, and June.
The government will cover 50 per cent of that reduction, with the property owner covering the rest.
If you are a small business that has been strongly affected by COVID-19 and you’re paying less than $50,000 per month on rent, you’ll be eligible to receive this support.
It will also be there for non-profits and charitable organizations that are struggling right now.
We’ll also have more to say in the coming days about rent support for larger businesses.
As I said yesterday, what we’re witnessing in long-term care facilities across the country is extremely troubling.
It’s unacceptable and our government will be there to help the provinces.
Members of the Canadian Armed Forces will be deployed after the Minister of Public Safety received and approved two formal requests from Ontario and Quebec.
Reconnaissance work is underway in both provinces. We’re identifying what needs to be done and mapping out next steps.
As I said many times before, we will be there for Quebecers, Ontarians, and all Canadians during this crisis.
We’re deploying the military to provide emergency support to help provinces regain control of the situation.
But we all know that this is only a short-term solution.
We’re also offering billions of dollars to provinces to top up the pay of essential workers and make sure that elderly Canadians get the support they deserve.
Later today, I’ll be meeting with the First Ministers to continue our work on supporting Canadians during this time.
We’re also going to talk about reopening parts of the economy.
Canada is a vast country and some regions have been hit harder than others during this pandemic.
We’re a federation, so we have to adapt our response to the realities and challenges of each province and territory.
But I want to be clear that getting back to normal will not happen overnight.
It’s going to take time. It won’t be as simple or as easy as flipping a switch.
It’ll require a lot of coordination at the national level and our government will be there to do that work.
We will be working with the provinces and territories to establish principles and guidelines to start reopening the economy safely.
Over the coming weeks, you’ll hear more talk about reopening, but you need to know we’re not out of the woods.
Since the beginning of this crisis, we have been learning about what’s being done in countries like South Korea, Japan, and Singapore.
But we see the challenges associated with reopening in certain places. So we have to be very careful.
Every location could take a different approach, so even if you hear on the news that another province is considering relaxing the rules, you must continue following the guidelines that apply in your location.
Otherwise, there’s a real risk that all the progress we have made to date will be lost.
It’s absolutely critical that everyone continues to follow local public health instructions as we move forward.
For now, these instructions are the same for all Canadians.
No matter where you live, you should be staying home as much as you possibly can.
You should be washing your hands regularly and you should always keep a safe distance of two metres from others.
That is the only way for us to make it through together.
Thank you very much.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-23,"Hello everyone.
Today at sundown marks the beginning of Ramadan.
For many Muslim Canadians, the coming month will be different than normal, with iftar online and virtual Friday prayers.
But that won’t change what this special time is all about – generosity, compassion, and service to others.  
Across the country, Muslim Canadians are on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 as nurses, doctors, and essential workers.
So thank you, and Ramadan Mubarak.
This will be another difficult day for many families and communities across the country.
We’re all thinking about those in Nova Scotia who are grieving the loss of loved ones, friends, and neighbours.
Yesterday, I spoke with the families of some of the people we lost.
They shared stories about their loved ones, and their dreams and plans.
In the face of such tragedy, their strength is remarkable.
I spoke also with RCMP members from the area and, on behalf of all Canadians, I thanked them for their service.
And I spoke to some local mayors as well to express my condolences.
For Torontonians, I know it’ll be a hard day as well, as we remember the victims of the van attack on Yonge Street two years ago.
Together we mourn, and together we heal.
Because just as Canadians were there for each other two years ago, we’re there for each other today.
Across the country, people are hanging tartan, blue ribbons, and scarves from windows to honour those who died.
With acts of kindness and donations, people are standing with families who are grieving.
And tomorrow, with the virtual vigil, we will all have the chance to show the people of Nova Scotia that they are not alone.  
These are tough times, but there is reason to hope. 
When it comes to COVID-19, what we’re doing is working.
And to continue on the right track, we need to be thinking not just about the next weeks, but about the next months.
We need medium-term and long-term solutions.  
On that front, I can announce today that we’re taking another step forward.
We’re putting in place an additional $1.1 billion for a national medical research strategy to address COVID-19.
This plan has three pillars: research on vaccines and other treatments, supports for clinical trials, and expanding national testing and modelling.
Let me start with the first pillar on research.
Under this plan, we are investing close to $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities across the country.
This is on top of the funding we’ve already provided to support vaccine development in Canada.
The second pillar of the plan is to make sure that once we have potential vaccines and treatments, we can test a wide range of options.
Under this plan, we will invest over $662 million for clinical trials led by Canada.
A vaccine is the long-term solution to this virus.
But these drugs will take months to develop, test, fabricate, and roll out.
So until we have something ready, we need to control the spread of the virus.
And that’s where the third pillar of this plan comes in.
We’re investing $350 million to expand national testing and modelling of COVID-19.
This includes creating the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force.
The task force will operate under the direction of a leadership group, which will include Dr. David Naylor, Dr. Catherine Hankins, Dr. Tim Evans, Dr. Theresa Tam, and Dr. Mona Nemer.
We are bringing together top health experts and scientists from leading institutions across the country.
Canada’s best and brightest will be working on serology testing – blood testing – to track and understand immunity to COVID-19.
They’ll be looking at key questions like how many people beyond those we’ve already tested have had COVID-19, whether you’re immune once you’ve had it, and if so, how long that lasts.
Over two years, we will be testing at least a million Canadians as a part of this study.
The findings of the research will help with everything from rollouts of a potential vaccine, to determining which public health measures are most effective going forward.
We will get valuable data, including disaggregated data, to understand the impact on vulnerable populations.
And we will also leverage new and existing lab capacity for research.
The better we understand this virus, its spread, and its impact on different people, the better we can fight it, and eventually defeat it.
While this vital research is happening, we’re also staying focused on what we can do right now to control COVID-19 and get back to normal as soon as possible.
Testing is key.
We’ve now reached 20,000 tests daily, almost double where we were earlier this month.
But testing must increase even further before we can re-open and re-start our normal activities as a country.
You’ve been doing your part by staying home and practising physical distancing.
It’s working.
And we can’t afford to waste this progress.
Right now, we’re seeing terrible tragedies in long-term care facilities across the country.
This is unacceptable.
If you’re angry, frustrated, scared – you are right to feel this way.
We can do better.
We need to do better.
Because we are failing our parents, our grandparents, our elders – the greatest generation who built this country.
We need to care for them properly.
Canadians need to pull together.
There have been requests for military assistance by both Ontario and Quebec, which of course we will be answering.
Our women and men in uniform will step up with the valour and courage they have always shown.
In the short term, we will be there with support so that provinces can get control of the situation.
But this is not a long-term solution.
In Canada, we shouldn’t have soldiers taking care of seniors.
Going forward, in the weeks and months to come, we will all have to ask tough questions about how it came to this.
We will all have to do more to get through this terrible situation.
Everyone is working hard to get through this.
We are all part of the same team.
As we do our part, I know that everyone will be doing their part.
We will get through this together, and we will come back strong together.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-22,"Hello everyone.
Before we get started, I want to talk about the latest updates coming out of Nova Scotia.
The RCMP has now confirmed that at least 22 people were killed in this weekend’s terrible attacks.
And we’re learning more about those who were taken from us. We’re seeing just how much each of them was loved.
Again, I want to extend my deepest condolences to all friends and families of the victims. Know that Canada is standing with you.
Right now, in incredibly difficult times, Canadians are reaching out to support each other.
People are asking what they can do to help.
I heard a great story of a young person here in Ottawa, named Felix, who’s one of those people putting up his hand.
A recent engineering grad from Carleton, he’d been working on communications satellites.
A few weeks ago, he talked to a local manufacturer about what they could do in the fight against COVID-19.
Now, they’ve started designing and creating reusable face shields for frontline workers.
And Felix isn’t the only one stepping up.
From coast to coast to coast, young people are pitching in and doing their part.
And so we’re going to do the same for them.
Many students are eligible for new programs we’ve brought in over the last few weeks.
Many students will get the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.
But others won’t, and that leaves some young people worried about what they’re going to do.
COVID-19 has meant that there aren’t as many jobs out there for students.
And without a job, it can be hard to pay for tuition or the day-to-day basics.
You might normally have turned to your parents for help, but right now mom and dad are stretched too.
And even if monthly bills aren’t the concern, you may have been counting on the summer job for next year’s tuition or to get the right experience for your career.
As young people, what you’re going through matters, and we want to make sure that you’ll be okay.  
So today, I’m announcing our plan to support students right across the country.
We’re launching the Canada Emergency Student Benefit to provide immediate help.
At the same time, we will create new student jobs and double student grants, among other things.
All of these measures will add up to approximately $9 billion for students.
For today, for the summer, for next year—we’re going to be there for you.
So let me start with the Canada Emergency Student Benefit.
Right now, you might be worried about how to make ends meet.
You probably can’t work your normal job, and that might be a big problem for rent or for groceries.
So, we’re bringing in the Canada Emergency Student Benefit to help.
With this Benefit, you’ll get $1,250 a month from May to August.
And if you take care of someone else or have a disability, that amount will go up to $1,750 each month.
This Benefit is designed for you—if you’re a post-secondary student right now, if you’re going to college in September, or if you graduated in December 2019.
It’s there for you even if you have a job, but you’re only making up to $1,000 a month.
The period covered by the Benefit will start on May 1, and your payments will be delivered through the Canada Revenue Agency.
We’ll be working with opposition parties to move forward on legislation to put this new Benefit in place.
For a lot of students, the month of May normally marks the start of a summer job.
But right now, it might be really tough to find something.
You may have been looking for weeks, without any success.
So we’re going to help.
Our government is creating 76,000 jobs for young people, in addition to the Canada Summer Jobs program.
These placements will be in sectors that need an extra hand right now, or that are on the frontlines of this pandemic.
We’re also going to be providing specific support for Indigenous students.
And for student researchers and graduate students, we’re going to invest over $291 million to extend scholarships, fellowships, and grants to make sure you can keep working.
Depending on your funding, it’ll be extended by either three or four months.
Of course, a paying job isn’t the only valuable way to spend your summer.
Volunteering can be a fantastic way to build skills, make contacts, or just give back.
If you’re volunteering instead of working, we’re going to make sure that you have support, too.
Students helping in the fight against COVID-19 this summer will soon be eligible for $1,000 to $5,000, depending on your hours, through the new Canada Student Service Grant.
Your energy and your skills can do a lot of good right now.
Things may be hard for the next little while, but we’re going to support you through it.
We’re doubling the student grants that the government gives out for the 2020-21 school year.
For students in Quebec, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, we will be providing funding to the provincial and territorial governments so that they can increase their financial aid programs.
At the same time, we’ll provide over $75 million to increase support specifically for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation students.
To all the students watching today, let me say this:
As you’re building your future—thinking about how to contribute, about starting a family or career—all of a sudden you’re faced with a massive crisis.
This uncertainty that you feel can be overwhelming.
But in Canada, we look out for each other. We value education, service, hard work. These measures will help you get through this, so that you can build that career and the future that you’ve been looking forward to—that we’ve been looking forward to for you. On the other side of this, when the economy comes roaring back, you’ll define our path forward. A path towards a better, more equal society—that’s what we’re doing together.
Today, on Earth Day, we are reminded that the way forward includes a healthy environment and a strong, sustainable economy.
Although our immediate focus is on the fight against COVID-19, we will always do our part to build a brighter future for tomorrow.  
Today, Earth Day reminds us that we need to balance a sustainable economy with a healthy environment.
Although we are focused on COVID-19 right now, we will always do what needs to be done to build a better future for our generation and future generations.
I know that all of our lives have changed in one way or another over the past six weeks. That right now, the future may look even more uncertain. No matter who you are—a student, an essential worker, or a business owner—we are here for you. And we need you to also do your part.
So, continue to stay at home, to wash your hands, and to stay two metres away from one another.
Thank you very much.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-21,"Hello everyone.
I want to begin by noting Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day.
Today, we remember the six million innocent Jewish men, women, and children who were systematically murdered by the Nazis.
We also pay tribute to the bravery and resilience of survivors, and of all of those who risked their lives to save others during the Holocaust.
This morning, I want to again extend my most sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims of the terrible Nova Scotia attacks.
Since yesterday, I’ve had the chance to speak with Constable Chad Morrison, the RCMP officer who was wounded, as well as Constable Heidi Stevenson’s family.
On behalf of all Canadians, I thanked them for their service and their sacrifice.
Yesterday, when I offered my sympathies to the RCMP officers who support me, I was amazed to see how many of them knew Heidi and had incredibly fond memories of her.
They’d worked with her on the Musical Ride.
They remembered her as an extraordinary person and it really goes to show just how tightly knit, not just the RCMP is as a force, but how close we are as a country.
Yesterday afternoon, I visited the Canadian Police and Peace Officers’ Memorial on Parliament Hill to pay tribute to Constable Stevenson and to recognize the contributions of all law enforcement members to keep us safe.
I also spoke to a number of colleagues from Nova Scotia both past and present, and sought Senator Stan Kutcher’s advice both as a Nova Scotian and as a mental health expert.
These calls reinforced what we all know about Nova Scotia – that it’s a special place where people stick together and look out for each other.
This week, we are all Nova Scotian.
The families of the victims can count on the unwavering support not only of their neighbours, but of every single Canadian.
It has now been several weeks that we’ve been asking everyone to follow the guidance of the experts to protect your health and the health of others.
Self-isolation, social and physical distancing – it’s an adjustment for the vast majority of us.
But for some, the consequences of this pandemic are much more profound than just an adjustment.
The effect of the virus has been to aggravate the inequalities that already existed in our society.
The most vulnerable – like seniors, homeless youth, the unemployed and single-parent families – have been hit especially hard by COVID-19.
At the same time, the total number of people who need assistance to get through this tough time has also increased.
Long before this pandemic, charities and non-profit organizations were doing crucial work to help our communities.
Their mission has always been to support people in their time of need and that hasn’t changed.
But COVID-19 is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on those organizations because more people need help.
I’m thinking for example of PEYO in Parc Extension which helps at-risk youth, or Mon Resto Saint Michel, which serves meals at an affordable price.
I’m also thinking about one United Way partner in Winnipeg who made and distributed 1,475 emergency kits for families, seniors, and homeless people in just five days back in March.
Organizations have also had to change the way they deliver services because of the rules that everyone has to follow to keep each other safe.
Here in Ottawa, there are a number of organizations that are focused on serving isolated seniors.
Usually, they have day programs where seniors can socialize, participate in activities, eat well, and maintain a connection to their community.
That’s no longer possible because of COVID-19, so organizations are now delivering meals and providing support via phone.
In Toronto, Tropicana Community Services is now helping vulnerable youth access their COVID-19 benefits.
Throughout the country, community organizations are an essential resource for the most vulnerable, and their mission during this pandemic has not changed.
It takes resources to make these kinds of adjustments – resources these groups don’t have because they’re spread so thin, trying to help as many people as possible.
So to support charities and non-profits in their important work, our government is setting up a $350 million Emergency Community Support Fund.
A portion of these funds will go directly to smaller, independent frontline organizations, and the rest will flow through national organizations like the United Way, Community Foundations Canada, and the Red Cross that can get funds to local organizations and vulnerable people quickly.
This is money for things like training volunteers, increasing at-home deliveries for seniors, or driving people with disabilities to appointments.
With this fund, we’re giving more resources to charities and non-profits so they can adapt to the new realities and difficulties brought on by this pandemic.
Our government is also helping business owners and entrepreneurs adapt to a new reality with the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
This new measure gives qualifying employers up to $847 per employee each week so they can keep people on the payroll.
Today, we’re launching a new calculator on the CRA website so businesses can determine the amount they can expect to claim through the wage subsidy.
Employers will be able to apply as of this Monday, April 27.
Later today, Minister Duclos will be providing more details regarding the rollout of this program.
And I want to turn now to some encouraging news on the innovation front.
Our supercluster initiative brings together small, medium-sized and large companies, academic institutions and not-for-profit organizations to generate bold ideas and innovate.
So, a few weeks ago, the Digital Technology Supercluster challenged its network of over 500 firms to come up with solutions to help Canadians get through this pandemic.
They received over 300 submissions and they are now moving forward on a number of key projects.
Toronto’s DNAstack is developing a new cloud-based network that allows researchers who are looking to improve our ability to diagnose and treat COVID-19 to share their findings.
Another company, Food-X, is working with its partners to develop an e-grocery management system to make sure our health care workers, seniors, and others have access to fresh food during this crisis.
Canadian innovators are among the best in the world and it’s great to see so many of them use their talents to help our communities.
This is yet another example of what we can achieve when we work together as Team Canada.
This week and over the coming weeks, you can count on us to keep finding new ways to help you.
We’ll continue to do our part just as you will continue to do yours.
It’s been about six weeks that you’ve been staying at home, washing your hands regularly and keeping two metres distance between yourselves and others.
A month and a half is a long time, but your efforts are paying off.
There are early but positive signs that we’re heading in the right direction – and it’s mainly thanks to you.
So keep following the advice of experts, and together, we’ll get through this.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-20,"Mr. Speaker,
I rise on this day, in this Chamber, as all of us and all Canadians are heartbroken.
Heartbroken for the 18 people confirmed killed in a senseless act of violence in Nova Scotia.
Heartbroken because the people whose lives were taken away will never be with us again.
Among them was Constable Heidi Stevenson, who died in the line of duty.
She was kind and she was gifted. She was a great police, and she was a great mom.
She embodied the values that built this country – values like integrity, honesty, and compassion.
For her community, she paid the ultimate price and her service will never be forgotten.
Like Constable Stevenson, many of the victims were also serving their community in the best way they knew how.
A teacher, a nurse.
A child’s grandparent, a parent’s child. 
Who has the words to ease our sorrow?
Because there are no words for the pain their families and loved ones feel today.
But I want them to know that all Canadians are with them.
That this senseless, evil act will not define Nova Scotia.
That today, all Canadians are Nova Scotian.
We share their grief.
We are mourning their loss.
And we will be there for them in the difficult days, weeks, and months ahead.
Mr. Speaker, we have eleven colleagues in this House who represent the people of Nova Scotia.
They are where they need to be today, with their communities across the province, grieving and supporting them.
We stand with them today and every day.
Mr. Speaker – people are having a hard time believing that such a tragedy could have happened in communities like Portapique, Truro, and Enfield.
In places where people know one another. Where they trust one another.
The kinds of places where people do not lock their doors.
As Senator Kutcher said to me this morning, in Nova Scotia, there are not six degrees of separation between people, but only two degrees.
Everyone knows each other. Everyone is in shock. 
But as this shock gives way to grief, many will also be angry.
Angry that families and friends are crying for the loved ones they lost.
Angry that they will not be able to gather together, in person, to celebrate the lives of those who have been taken from us.
Mr. Speaker – this has been a heartbreaking year for Canadians.
From January onwards, it felt like every time we turned on the news, we’d see reports of violence that could not be stopped, of lives that could not be saved.
This horrific tragedy is happening at a time when Canadians from coast to coast to coast are making sacrifices to keep each other safe.
At a time where they are making the right choices, every single day, to prevent more heartbreak and more tragedy.
So, when we awoke yesterday to horrific reports coming out of Nova Scotia, many of us probably asked ourselves, just how much more can we take?
Mr. Speaker – in our darkest moments, what motivates us to move forward is the common pursuit of a better tomorrow.
Our country’s very recent history is not without obstacles or sadness.
Three years ago, we mourned the loss of six innocent people who were murdered while they were praying in Sainte-Foy.
We did not let this act of hatred stop us from our pursuit of a better tomorrow.
Two years ago, we mourned a young woman, a little girl, and the many injured on Toronto’s Danforth, while simply enjoying a summer evening in the neighbourhood.
We did not let that stop us from our common pursuit of a better tomorrow.
And over this past year, we have seen far too many communities shattered, far too many families torn apart by violence and by acts of hate.
We will not let that stop us from our common pursuit of a better tomorrow.
In our darkest hours, we have always answered hate with hope.
We have chosen unity over division.
Because Mr. Speaker, no one man’s actions, no matter how cruel, how destructive, or how evil, can build a wall of despair between us and that better tomorrow.
Mr. Speaker – today is a heartbreaking day for all Canadians.
But while we are united in our grief, we must also be united in our resolve to uphold our values.
To live by the example of those who left us too soon.
To let hope, love, and compassion guide us during the difficult days, weeks, and months ahead.
Because our better tomorrow will come.
It might not be this week or even this month.
But it will come.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-20,"Hello everyone.
We are a country that stands united in our effort to defeat a pandemic, to save lives, and to help each other make it to a better day.
But yesterday, we were jolted from that common cause by the senseless violence and tragedy in Nova Scotia.
A gunman claimed the lives of at least 18 people, plunging their families and friends into mourning. 
Among them, a woman in uniform, whose job it is to protect lives even if it endangers her own. Constable Heidi Stevenson of the RCMP.
Constable Stevenson died protecting others.
She was answering the call of duty, something she had done every day when she went to work for 23 years.
This happened in small towns.
Portapique, Truro, Milford, and Enfield are places where people have deep roots. Places where people know their neighbours and look out for one another.
There, everyone knows a Mountie because they’re everything from police officers to social workers to teen counselors.
Now these communities are in mourning and Canada is in mourning with them.
To the grandparent who lost a child, the children who lost a parent, to the neighbour who lost a friend – we are so sorry for your loss.
Such a tragedy should’ve never occurred. Violence of any kind has no place in Canada.
We stand with you and we grieve with you.
Our hearts go out to you as you go through this very painful time.
And you can count on our government’s full support during this incredibly painful time.
I also want to wish a full and speedy recovery to all those injured, including another RCMP officer.
Canada is a vast and sweeping country, filled with long stretches of lonely roads.
With unwavering courage and compassion, our Royal Canadian Mounted Police patrol these roads to keep us safe, as they have for over a hundred years.
I know that from coast to coast to coast, the women and men who wear the Red Serge in service to Canada are grieving deeply the loss of one of their own – and one of our best.
This tragedy is a painful reminder of the risks all of our first responders take to keep us safe.
Of the sacrifices they make every single day to protect our communities. Paramedics, doctors, nurses, firefighters, and police officers – they’re always here for us.
They’ve been stepping up through the pandemic and yesterday, in Nova Scotia, they showed that bravery.
I want to take a moment to thank them all for their professionalism and their courage.
Many of you are already working overtime because of this pandemic. Our communities need you now more than ever and I know that can weigh on you at times.
These are exceptional circumstances, yet you did what you always do.
You ran towards danger. Without pause, without hesitation, you put your life on the line.
On behalf of all Canadians – thank you for your service.
This day is made all the more difficult because of the precious lives lost and the senseless act of one person. 
Just how could this happen? We may never know why.
But we do know this.
No one man’s action can build a wall between us and a better day – no matter how evil, how thoughtless, or how destructive.
Canadians are kind and generous.
We are there for each other and we look out for one another.
As families grieve the loss of a loved one, all Canadians are standing with them.
The pandemic will prevent us from mourning together in person, but a vigil will be held virtually to celebrate the lives of the victims at 7 p.m. on Friday through the Facebook group “Colchester - Supporting our Communities.”
It will be an opportunity to celebrate the victims’ lives and to be there for their families and friends.
I hope that many of you will join in.
As we learn more about what happened yesterday, it’s important that we come together to support communities.
In the hours since the tragedy, I’ve spoken with Premier McNeil, RCMP Commissioner Lucki, Minister Blair, and many Nova Scotians, including our Nova Scotia caucus.
We will continue to work together to see this through.
I know that people have a lot of questions. This is an ongoing investigation, but I can assure you that the RCMP and local authorities will keep you updated.
I want to ask the media to avoid mentioning the name and showing the picture of the person involved.
Do not give him the gift of infamy.
Let us instead focus all our intention and attention on the lives we lost, and the families and friends who grieve.
I want to close today by addressing all the kids in Nova Scotia and right across the country.
I know the world can seem like a mean and ugly place right now, but there’s a whole lot of good in the world too.
You’ll see it in your neighbours and in Canadians in the days and weeks and months ahead.
This is a difficult time – and it can be a scary time too – but we’re here for you.
And we’re going to get through this together.
I promise.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-19,"Hello everyone,  
Before we get started, I want to touch briefly on the unfolding events in Portapique, Nova Scotia.
I know we’ve all been watching this on the news.
My heart goes out to everyone affected, in what is a terrible situation.
I want to thank the police for their hard work, and people for cooperating with authorities.
I want to wish a happy Orthodox Easter to everyone who is celebrating today.
Even if it’s just over Skype, I hope you can spend this special day with family and friends.
Although this pandemic has affected everyone, some people have been hit especially hard.
Right now, too many Canadians are facing some really difficult situations.
If you live with a disability, I don’t have to tell you what this can look like.
You might be worried about whether your support worker will be able to keep coming.
You might be concerned about getting groceries or about your finances.
And if you’re caring for someone with a disability, you’re probably anxious about getting support, too.
Your voice matters.
Your experience is important.
And our government is listening.
If this crisis has laid bare the gaps that still exist for far too many Canadians, it has also given us an opportunity to address them.
It has encouraged us to have even more meaningful conversations about how we make our country a more inclusive, and a more equitable place.
Last week, Minister Qualtrough launched a COVID-19 Disability Advisory Group as part of our plan to keep all Canadians healthy, informed, and safe.
We’re addressing key issues like equal access to healthcare and information, as well as support on jobs and income.
And we’re doing all of this work with you at the table.
On that note, I want to recognize the outstanding organizations right across the country, like the Rick Hansen Foundation, that are bringing these issues to the fore.
You are doing incredible work, and we are proud to be your partner.
In response to the pandemic, we have developed a three-point economic plan to help Canadians get through this tough time.
We introduced the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to help people who’ve lost their wages, we brought in new loans for businesses, and we introduced the wage subsidy.
But there is still work to do.
There are still people to reach.
That’s why, this past week, we expanded the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to include workers making up to $1,000 a month, seasonal workers, and those whose EI regular benefits have recently run out.
It’s why we put in place new measures to support people in the energy industry, which is suffering right now.
And we also brought in support for people who continue to do incredible work in the arts, culture, and sports communities.
And it’s why we have kept making progress with the provinces and territories on increasing wages for essential workers who need it.
Now, things are tough for employers, too.
So we brought in a whole range of additional support, on loans and credit, and for Indigenous businesses and businesses in the North.
And for communities that need extra support, we approved requests to have the Canadian Armed Forces assist in Quebec long-term care facilities, as well as in Nunavik and in Basse-Côte-Nord.
Today, I can announce that we have also approved the extension of a request from the Government of Quebec, for the Canadian Rangers to help NEW-tash-kwan and Eh-KWAN-eh-chit First Nations near Basse-Côte-Nord.
All these measures we’ve brought in are about helping you do the things that will get us through this.
And it’s working.
We’re seeing the numbers trend in the right direction.
So we need to keep doing what we’re doing, and keep being extremely careful.
And we will get through this together.
That said, although we’re seeing encouraging trends, we need to be realists.
Across the country, thousands of families are living through dreadful situations and having heart-wrenching moments because of this pandemic.
I would like to take this time to express my condolences to those who are in mourning.
Every Canadian shares your sorrow and stands with you through this terrible hardship.
Know that the government is there for you, and we will get through these difficult moments together.
It’s hard to watch the news without thinking about these seniors in their homes who can’t see their children or their grandchildren, except through FaceTime, and who are afraid.   
Who see the news about the situation in seniors’ centres across the province, across the country. They are worried and left wondering whether they’ll ever see their children and grandchildren some day.
It is extremely difficult and we must do everything for them by working together, and also by emphasizing that we must continue to stay home, we must continue to stop the spread of this virus, and together we’ll get through it.  
And because it’s Sunday, I want to end again by talking directly to all the kids who might be watching.
This week is National Volunteer Week.
That means we say thank you to everyone around us doing things like helping seniors get groceries, or putting in a shift at a foodbank.
You can join in from home too.
Ask your parents if you can help them make dinner and do extra cleaning around the house.
Help your brother or sister with schoolwork.
Say hi – over FaceTime – to your grandparents, who I know are missing you.
Young, and young at heart, we can all make a real difference.
I heard a great story the other day about a restaurant in Nova Scotia, The Canteen.
They’ve turned their restaurant into a community kitchen, where people pitch in and get meals to those in need. 
And there have been thousands of Canadians who have already signed up through our National COVID-19 Volunteer Recruitment Campaign, to lighten the load on our frontline workers.
Everyone can help out. Everyone can help us get through this.
And right now, as we face a challenge like none we’ve ever known, we all have a chance to contribute.
And I know that we will all continue to do our part.
Thank you very much.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-06,"Hello, everyone.
I want to start this morning by recognizing that today is a painful anniversary.
It has now been two years since the tragic Humboldt Broncos crash.
From coast to coast to coast, we remember the 16 lives that ended much too soon, and the many more that were changed forever.  
If you lost a friend, a teammate, or a loved one, if you’re still rebuilding and recovering, I want you to know that we’re here for you, and we will always be here for you.
You – the community of Humboldt, along with all Canadians who stand with you – have shown incredible strength and resilience.
And just like the people putting out hockey sticks or wearing the jersey – you remind us that together, we can get through even the darkest of times.  
Right now, as we face a challenge unlike any other, we lean on our friends and family.
And we let them know that they can lean on us, too.
The weeks and months ahead won’t be easy.
But we’re going to get through this together.
I’m sure many of you watched the Queen’s address yesterday afternoon.
And her message of unity and resolve is more important than ever.
No one should feel alone in this.
No one should wonder how they’ll weather this storm without support.  
Over the past few weeks, we’ve brought in a whole range of new measures – to help families and workers, seniors and business owners get through this. 
Taken together, we’ve introduced the biggest economic measures in our lifetime, which will help millions of people.
That includes the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, for if you’ve lost your paycheque.
Whether you’re taking care of someone who’s sick, have been laid off, or are living with a disability – the CERB is there for you.
This benefit is now available starting today.
If you’re born in January, February, or March, you can go to Canada.ca and apply online.
If you can’t apply online, don’t worry – you can call 1-800-959-2041.
Since it opened this morning, 240,000 people have already successfully applied.
For everyone else, you’ll be able to apply another day this week, depending on your birth month.
We know you need this support as soon as possible.
We have to make sure this system works, for everyone.
If you’re using direct deposit, you will receive money three to five days later.
The CERB is meant to help all Canadians who need it, and millions of Canadians will be getting it starting this week.
But there are some people who don’t yet qualify, who we do need to help.
If you’re working reduced hours, down to 10 hours a week or less, we will soon announce how you will be able to qualify for the CERB.
This is to help you if you’re a gig worker, a contract worker, or a volunteer firefighter.
We’ll also have more to say for those who are working, but making less than they would with the benefit.
I’m thinking in particular of homecare workers or long-term care workers looking after vulnerable seniors.
And I know there are also lots of university or college students wondering what kind of job you’ll get this summer.
You need support now, and work is underway to get it to you as soon as possible.
For people in all of these situations, we see you.
We’re going to be there for you.
And we’re working as hard as we can to get you the support you need.
At the same time, we also announced a new, 75 per cent wage subsidy to help you keep your job and help businesses keep their employees on the payroll.
Right now, we’re drafting legislation and talking to other parties ahead of bringing Parliament back to put the wage subsidy in place as quickly as possible.
Supporting you, and your family, is our top priority.
Your Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, will have more updates soon, but here’s the bottom line.
Whatever your situation, we are working to get you the help you need.
We are working very hard to give you a break and to help you manage your financial situation.
Banks have an important role to play because they have the power to help companies continue operating and to help families pay their mortgage.
The decision of the six major banks, and of certain credit unions, to cut credit card interest rates almost in half for people in financial difficulty because of the pandemic, will give them much-needed relief on debt.
I also want to thank Minister Morneau for his outstanding leadership on this.
And we need to see even more action like this going forward.
Because this is a time to think about each other, not about the bottom line.
On that note, I want to recognize the new initiative the Canadian Chamber of Commerce launched in partnership with our government.
The Canadian Business Resilience Network will help businesses of all sizes not just get through this tough period, but drive our economic recovery afterwards.
This builds on what we’ve already done to help business owners. 
We have a three-point economic plan – it supports business owners, including through new loans, while safeguarding jobs with the wage subsidy, and helping those who no longer have a paycheque with the CERB.
We’re here for you.
In order to get through this, and keep our loved ones and our frontline workers safe, all Canadians need to do their part.
Don’t forget that you are shaping our future today.
What the next weeks and months look like depends on you.
It depends on whether you stay home.
Whether you help protect the vulnerable and make sure our hospitals aren’t overwhelmed.
Every citizen has to do their part.
Because those who have to continue going to work—nurses, doctors, ambulance attendants, laboratory technicians, maintenance workers, truck drivers, and agricultural workers, to name a few—are doing more than their part. 
They are making sacrifices so that the rest of the population can stay home.
The best way to thank them is to continue following the health experts’ guidelines.
This is how we can all protect our own health and theirs.
Thank you for joining us today.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and additional measures to fight economic impacts of COVID-19,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/04/06/prime-ministers-remarks-canada-emergency-response-benefit-and-additional
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-05,"Hello everyone. Happy Sunday.
This morning, I would first like to thank everyone working weekends.
Truckers, grocers, pharmacists and health professionals—as always—thank you.
But, today, I would also like to thank agricultural workers who feed our families.
You are going through particularly tough times.
But, thanks to you, we can stay home knowing that we can count on you to feed our families and our communities.
We greatly appreciate everything that you are doing for us, and we will be there to support you.
Over the past few weeks, we’ve all had to make changes to keep each other safe and healthy, and it’s a big adjustment.
While we still have a lot of work to do, we’re making good progress on getting you the support you need as quickly as possible.
And that’s what I want to start with today.
Earlier this week, we announced more details on how you can access the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if you’ve lost your job or your paycheque.
Starting tomorrow, you’ll be able to sign up to receive this support by going to Canada.ca.
If you choose direct deposit, you will get a first payment within 3 to 5 days.
If you choose to receive your benefit by mail, you’ll get money within the next 10 days.
I know it can be hard to keep your spirits up these days.
But one thing that should give us all hope is the way we’ve come together as a country.
Crises such as this one test the limits of our solidarity.
And in these difficult times, we’ve seen businesses step up to help protect our health care workers.
We’ve seen doctors and nurses come out of retirement.
We’ve seen people raise money for local food banks, check on their friends, and help our most vulnerable.
Many of you may be wondering how you can help, and I want to remind you that the very best thing you can do to fight this pandemic is to follow public health recommendations.
Wash your hands and stay at home, except for critical things like getting groceries or medications and try to make that trip only once a week.
And if you do have to go out, keep a safe distance of at least 2 metres from others.
That’s how you can keep doing your part.
But for those of you with specialized skills looking to help our frontline workers, we do want to hear from you.
Health Canada is building an inventory of specialized volunteers that provinces and territories can draw on to provide more support to our health care workers.
This could include tracking cases and tracing contact, as well as collecting and reporting data.
If you can help, please sign up online at Canada.ca/coronavirus.
Applications will be open until April 24.
We’re also offering full-time jobs to all reservists in the Canadian Forces.
We’re contacting reservists across the country to see if they are interested and offering them the same pay and benefits as regular-force personnel for the coming months.
Bolstering the military’s ranks will help offset some of the economic consequences of COVID-19 and ensure that our communities are well supported.
In this crisis, everything you do counts.
If you refuse to follow the experts’ advice, you are not just endangering your own life or that of your loved ones.
You are endangering the health of all members of society.
I’m not saying this to be dramatic.
233 Canadians have lost their lives because of COVID-19 and hundreds of families are now in mourning.
I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to all bereaved families.
We are going through these difficult times together.
We are here for you.
To overcome this crisis, we all need to be aware of the consequences of our actions.
If you do not do your part, your fellow citizens will pay the price.
But it also works the other way.
If you follow the experts’ advice, your whole community will benefit.
So, let’s focus on doing just that. Let’s continue to do our part.
That is how we will get through this challenge, together.
And I want to close today with a message for kids.
Thank you all for sending me your questions over the past few days.
Dr. Tam and I had a great time answering those questions this morning. 
Later today, astronauts Jeremy Hansen and David St-Jacques will be on YouTube, so be sure to tune in.
David just returned to Earth after spending many months in space and he knows a thing or two about staying indoors and only talking to friends and family via video conference.
I know these are tough times for kids and young people right across the country, and indeed around the world, but know that the support you’re giving your parents and all of us as we work through this, the way you’re helping out, the way you’re focusing on doing your homework and keeping your school work up, and the way you’re learning to adapt to this new situation that we will all remember for the rest of our lives.
Thank you for everything you guys are doing to keep us getting through this.
Thank you very much, everyone.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-04,"Hello everyone.
The last few weeks have been hard in different ways for everyone.
You’re worried about your job or your business.
You’re concerned about your health, or the health of an elderly parent.
No matter what this has meant for you, I know you’re looking for answers.
Knowing where we are now, and where we might be in the coming weeks and months, is how we can all figure out our response.
For you, that could be planning on how to make sure the kids keep learning even though they’re at home.
For our government, the numbers and data compiled by our experts are critical to understanding the scope of this pandemic and informing the decisions we make to keep you safe.
And we’ve made sure you can access the most reliable, accurate information available to us at Canada.ca/coronavirus.
We’re going to keep releasing up-to-date data on a daily basis and using it to inform our decisions.
And we’ll continue working with the provinces and territories on getting new information to have a complete, national picture that we’ll share with you.
Regardless of the varying models or predictions, one thing is consistently clear.
The measures that have been put in place by all orders of government, from closing schools to staying home, are saving lives.
But this will only keep working if everyone continues to do their part.
If everyone takes their duty – to nurses and doctors, to the elderly, and to the vulnerable – seriously.
As seriously as if it were the life of their parent or their child on the line.  
Because it is.
The cashier at the store is someone’s brother.
The paramedic saving lives is someone’s wife.
That’s what’s at stake here.
The lives of the people we love.
The lives of the people our neighbours love.
So do your part.
Wash your hands, stay two metres away from each other.
And above all, stay home.
We’ve been staying home for several weeks now.
In fact, home is where most of us feel safest right now.
But imagine if you were more afraid to stay home than to face the pandemic.
Unfortunately, that’s the reality for far too many Canadians.
It’s what women who are victims of violence face on a daily basis.
No one should have to choose between being somewhere they’re unsafe, and risking getting COVID-19.
That’s why we’ve invested $40 million for women’s shelters and sexual assault centres across the country.
And for Indigenous women and children fleeing violence, we’re providing $10 million for emergency shelters.
This funding will help women’s shelters take all the necessary steps to protect people, not only from violence but also from COVID-19.
For other shelters, we’ve boosted funding for the Reaching Home program by over $157 million.
This will help buy things like physical barriers, or rent new space to keep people safe. 
The communities that need this funding have now been identified, and money is getting to them.
For people from Victoria to Hamilton, Regina to St. John’s, Vancouver to Saskatoon, and Toronto to Halifax, help has arrived.
It’s not just about giving people a safe place to go to escape violence, or to avoid having to sleep on the street.
It’s also about protecting all members of our society from COVID-19—and that includes the most vulnerable.
I know we’re asking a lot right now.
To stay home, to not see friends, to close your business temporarily.
It’s not easy.
I get that.
But these sacrifices are necessary.
The price of acting otherwise is just too steep.
To those who are sick right now or have family in hospital in the ICU, to those who have lost a loved one or a friend: we’re thinking of you.
We’re here for you.
And you remind us of what’s on the line.
We all need to take physical distancing very seriously.
Done right, these measures will save lives and bridge us slowly but surely back to normal.
At the same time, we’re working around the clock to get Canada the resources we need.
In the next 48 hours, we will be receiving a shipment of millions of masks by a chartered cargo flight.
We’re also working with provinces to transport their medical supplies when possible.
Items ordered by Quebec will be on this flight.
Our government has also leased a warehouse in China to help collect and distribute these items as quickly as possible.  
And going forward, the flights we’re chartering to get the materials here include Canadian companies Cargojet and Air Canada.
I want to take a moment to thank everyone – whether you’re working in a warehouse, flying the plane, or part of the ground crew – for your dedication.
These are vital supplies for people on the front lines, and are key to fighting the virus.
People in our hospitals are saving lives every single day.
They can’t be worried about running out of the equipment that’ll keep them and you safe.
And for everyone else, to give our country the best shot possible, we’re doing everything we can to support you while you do your part. 
So this weekend, stay at home.
Protect your loved ones and our frontline workers.
Save lives.
I want to take a moment to talk to kids again today.
Even at home, there’s lots of stuff going on, there’s lots of stuff to do.
I’ll be holding a videoconference tomorrow with Dr. Tam to talk through some of your questions.
I know a lot of you have sent them in and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Tomorrow, you’ll also have a chance to ask two people who know better than anyone else about staying inside – astronauts.
Canadian astronauts Jeremy Hansen and David Saint-Jacques will be live on YouTube tomorrow to talk with you, so ask your parents to help send in a question ahead of time.
To protect your wages and the economy, we’ve introduced a three-point plan that will allow us to safeguard jobs, support small businesses, and help those who no longer have a paycheque.
To protect your health and the health of all our essential workers, we are working with a number of companies to ensure the production and distribution of medical supplies and personal protective equipment.
We will help you get through this.
But we need you to do your part.
I know I can count on you all.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks updating Canadians on supplies and support for shelters,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/04/04/prime-ministers-remarks-updating-canadians-supplies-and-support-shelters
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-03,"Good morning everyone.
Thank you for joining us today.
Before we get into things, I have two pieces of news to share with everyone.
The first one is about the distribution of critical equipment to provinces and territories.
For the past few weeks, our government has been working closely with industry to produce the supplies our health care workers need like masks, face shields, gowns, ventilators, and test kits.
Well today, I can announce that our government has signed an agreement with Amazon Canada to manage the distribution of this equipment to the provinces and territories.
Amazon will use its wide distribution network to deliver medical equipment where it is needed the most.
The second announcement I want to make this morning is about the army.
We have received a request from the Government of Quebec for help from the Canadian Armed Forces for northern and isolated communities.
As I said earlier this week, our Canadians in uniform are always ready to help communities fight COVID-19.
I can therefore confirm that the Armed Forces will be there for Quebecers and for all Canadians.
COVID-19 has been turning our lives upside down for a few weeks now.
We are doing school work at home. We are limiting travel. We are staying at home as much as possible.
The pandemic is having consequences on all of us, but some families are going through even more difficult and uncertain times.
If you have lost your job, if you are not getting a paycheque, you are wondering how you are going to not only pay your bills at the end of the month, but also buy food the next day.
Across the country, there are food banks that can help.
Food banks and charities do incredible work for our communities all year long.
But like most organizations, food banks are facing new challenges because of this pandemic.
For example, most of their volunteers are retirees, who are more at risk of catching COVID-19. This means fewer people to serve a growing clientele.
With everyone staying home, they have fewer volunteers. And a difficult economic climate means that they are receiving fewer donations that they normally would while demand rises.
The staff at the Neighbour to Neighbour Food Bank in Hamilton told us that they’re getting more and more calls. And it’s overwhelming for the volunteers who are spread really thin and working overtime to help their community.
There is also Maison de Quartier Villeray, which I have known for many years, where people work extremely hard to help their neighbours in my riding of Papineau.
The work being done by food banks and their volunteers is essential, so there’s no question that they need more support during this crisis.
If you have the time and the ability to help, reach out to your local food bank and ask them how you can help them.
At the same time, I’m announcing that the government will provide $100 million to meet the urgent food needs of vulnerable Canadians, including those living in Indigenous and northern communities.
This money will help ensure that organizations can buy and deliver food to those who need it the most.
It will help support organizations you may already know like Food Banks Canada, Breakfast Club, Moisson Montréal, the Salvation Army, and many more.
And on that note, I do want to take a moment to thank all the volunteers and organizers.
Thank you for feeding our communities, we see you and we are grateful for the incredible, tireless, work you do even in these extremely difficult circumstances, especially in these extremely difficult circumstances. You are doing essential work for our most vulnerable. You are showing what it is to be Canadian, to be there for each other in times of difficulty.
I know that many of you are having a hard time right now.
The pandemic is creating a lot of uncertainty and you’re worried.
But I want you to know that our government will not let you down.
We are investing in food banks so that you can meet your family’s urgent needs during this crisis.
And, at the same time, we are providing financial support to those who have lost their job or their paycheque because of COVID-19.
We are implementing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which will provide you with $2,000 a month.
Our government is also supplementing the GST Credit to help low-income people.
We had said that in May, every qualifying adult would receive up to $300 with $150 for each child, but I can now confirm that help is coming sooner, this month, in April instead.
Our government has also been working with major banks to deliver benefits, including the CERB, through direct deposit.
Effective today, people should visit their bank’s website for information on how to enroll for direct deposit if they haven’t already.
I know that a lot of you want to know how long this is going to last.
You are asking when you will be able to see your friends, hug your grandparents, and have people over for dinner.
Last night, I spoke with the provincial and territorial premiers and we mainly discussed the sharing of information and projections.
The good news is, we are testing a lot more people and the experts have new data to analyze.
The provinces and territories are currently updating their data and will publish the latest information soon.
As for the federal government, we are working very hard to check the latest figures so we can post them online.
Please visit canada.ca/coronavirus for the best up-to-date information on the spread of the virus. 
I would love to be able to tell you exactly when this will end. I often talk about weeks or maybe even months, but the truth is, it will really depend on each of us.
The best way to minimize the impact of COVID-19 is to continue following the experts’ advice.
You know what they are saying.
Stay home as much as possible.
Limit non-essential trips.
And if you must absolutely go out, stay at least two metres away from other people.
Continue doing your part and I promise you we will get through this.
I want to close with a message for kids.
On Sunday, I will be holding a video conference focused on you with Dr. Tam.
So, send me your questions through the CBCKids’ website by the end of the day, and I’m looking forward to answering you this weekend.
Thank you very much, everyone.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-02,"Hello, everyone.
It is clear that the last few weeks have been very difficult for a lot of people.
You’re wondering how you’re going to be able to work from home or how you’re going to pay your bills after losing your job.
It can be hard to keep your morale up.
It’s normal to be frustrated.
But if you’re going through a particularly dark time, please ask for help.
There are people who can help you.
And if you think a friend or a family member needs help, give them a call.
Tell them you’re there for them.
We are going through a difficult time, but we’re going through it together, and help is on the way.
This evening, I’ll be chairing a First Ministers’ Meeting with the premiers.
We’re going to talk about how to continue working together to keep people safe and supported.
Over the last few weeks, in the face of an unprecedented challenge, we’ve seen all levels of government cooperating on a response.
And going forward, that collaboration will become even more important.
We will be there to support the provinces and territories with whatever they need.
This includes sending personal protective equipment and other supports for the health care system.
Last night, we received a shipment of over a million masks to a Hamilton warehouse.
I know that people there have been working overnight to validate these supplies.
This is in addition to the 10 million masks that have come in over the last days and are being distributed to the provinces and territories as quickly as possible.
And this Team Canada effort goes beyond government.
About two weeks ago, we launched Canada’s Plan to Mobilize Industry to fight COVID-19.
Since then, we’ve spoken to almost 3,000 companies, helping us secure millions of pieces of vital equipment.
I want to share a quintessentially Canadian example of this collaboration.
Our government has ordered hundreds of thousands of face shields from Bauer – the people who make hockey gear.
They’re creating shields to protect nurses and doctors against COVID-19. 
This is exactly the kind of innovative, collaborative thinking we need right now.
And I know we’re going to see more of it in the coming days.
In our conversation tonight, the premiers and I will also discuss our continued coordination and sharing of data and modelling.
We need to work together to know what’s needed – where and when – for communities right across the country.
Provinces have been making significant progress on testing backlogs, which is giving experts important data to analyze.
And we’re constantly getting and validating more data.
That means we can share more information with you.
You can go to Canada.ca/coronavirus for the latest information about cases, growth, and spread.
But I know a lot of people are still wondering when this’ll get better, or how much worse it might become.
You want to see the numbers and the predictions.
You wake up in the morning and look online for the latest, most credible data you can find.
You want to plan. 
You want to prepare for the worst.
You want to know what to be hopeful about.
I know.
And we’ll have more information, keeping coming to you with it, soon.
But the biggest variable in shaping these projections is you and your behaviour.
You must listen to the world-class doctors who are already sharing the best available information and advice.
Ignoring them puts lives at risk.
It’s up to you to do the right thing.
While many of you are staying home and limiting trips to the grocery store, too many still aren’t.
What the experts are telling us is that we must do everything we can today and tomorrow, to set us on the right path for next week and next month.
It takes time for the effects of our actions to be felt.
So if we don’t want our hospitals to be overwhelmed in the coming weeks, we need to make the right choices, and we need to make them now.
Our public health care system is strong, and our health care professionals are remarkable – but they’re facing a threat.
If every single one of us steps up right now, we can help them.
If you listen to doctors, if you stay home, if you stay away from other people – we won’t overwhelm our hospitals.
We will protect our doctors and nurses.
We will protect our friends and neighbours.
It’s going to take distancing and time to flatten the curve.
But that’s how we’ll get through this.
So let’s save lives together, by staying apart.
We’ll keep working around the clock to get you the help you need to do just that.
To protect your job, your business or your salary, we have launched a three-part economic plan that will help you until things get better.
Thanks to the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, we are helping your employer to keep you on board.
With new guaranteed loans for businesses of all sizes, we are helping business owners access credit to get through this difficult time.  
And with the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, we are going to help you until things settle down, if you have lost your job or your income.
I want you to know that we’re giving this fight everything we’ve got.
Just yesterday, we announced the biggest economic measures in our lifetime.
Governments of all orders are organizing the most significant civic mobilization since the Second World War.
Doctors and nurses, truckers and air cargo operators are scaling up operations to levels we’ve never seen before in our history.
But here’s the truth.
None of that will be enough without your help.
The meaning of serving your country changes from one generation to the next.
Your grandfather may have served his country by fighting in a war overseas.
Your mother may have fought for more equality.
Now, it’s your turn.
It’s your turn to contribute to the effort.
You can serve your country by staying home and following the rules.
I know it sounds simple, but it’s the only way to get through this.
Everyone has to do their part.
Everyone has to sacrifice their routine now so life can get back to normal one day.
I know that we can and will do it, together.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-01,"Hello everyone.
I want to start this morning by wishing everyone a happy Sikh Heritage Month.
Every day, Sikh Canadians make our cities and neighbourhoods stronger.
And right now, when people need help most, you’re stepping up once again.
In Regina, you’re delivering supplies to your neighbours, while in Mississauga, you’re donating to the Seva Food Bank.
It just goes to show that we are all stronger together, supporting each other. 
You are doing your part.
And so many others are doing the same.
To the people on the front lines, thank you:
To farmers and truck drivers.
To those delivering air cargo.
To nurses and doctors.
You are working day and night so that we can eat and take our medication.
You are protecting our health and the health of our families.
Your government is here for you. And we all say thank you.
Our government has introduced a three-point economic plan to protect jobs, help people laid off, and support businesses.
If you’re worried about your job – we’re helping your employer keep you on the payroll with the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
Later today, Minister Morneau, Minister Ng, and Minister Bains will provide an update about this 75 per cent wage subsidy.
But what I can say now is that it’s going to be available for businesses, big and small, that are not publicly funded and have seen a 30 per cent or more decline in gross revenues.
That includes everything from bars and restaurants, to charities and non-profits.
Applications will soon open through the Canada Revenue Agency.
Like I said on Friday, this money is for workers.
Employers will need to attest that they are doing everything they can to pay the remaining 25 per cent of people’s wages.
These are unprecedented times, and will require us to pull together as a country and trust each other as Canadians.
So there will be stiff and severe penalties for trying to take advantage of this system and of your fellow Canadians.
These are unprecedented times so we’re taking unprecedented action.
And while we put this measure in place, we’re continuing to move forward on the other two prongs of our economic plan.
To help business owners worried about rent or other bills, we’ve brought in new loans. 
And to help people who lose their paycheck, whether they’re freelance or have been laid off, we created the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.
And on that front, I have some good news to share.
Starting April 6th, you will be able to apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.
A reminder, if you’re getting the wage subsidy from your employer, you can’t collect the CERB.
It’s one or the other.
You can’t get both of these benefits.
For the CERB, you can register online at Canada.ca.
By selecting direct deposit, you should receive your payment within 3 to 5 days.
And if you can’t apply online, don’t worry.
You can call the Canada Revenue Agency for help over the phone.
By mail, you’ll get your cheque within 10 days.
After applying, all you need to do to keep getting this benefit, is check in every month to say that you’re still out of work.
And if you’ve already applied through EI, you’re all set up.
You don’t need to do anything on April 6th.
We’re putting measures in place so that we don’t overload the system, but I can assure you that everyone will get their money.
Later today, Minister Duclos and Minister Qualtrough will have more details on this whole process, from eligibility to applying to getting your cheque. 
But the bottom line is this: 
We’re getting you the help you need, when you need it.
We have a plan to protect jobs, to help those who have been laid off, and to support businesses that are having cash flow problems.
And we’re not done yet.
We’re going to keep working hard to make sure you’re getting the support you need.
This is the largest economic program in Canada’s history.
And so I’ve asked the House Leader and the Deputy Prime Minister to reach out to the other parties about bringing back Parliament.
This must be a Team Canada effort.
Governments of all orders across the country are stepping up to fulfill their responsibilities to Canadians.
Canada hasn’t seen this type of civic mobilization since the Second World War.
These are the biggest economic measures in our lifetimes – to defeat a threat to our health.
These historic measures will support Canadians to stay home to defeat COVID-19.
But the government alone cannot win this fight.
We all have to answer the call of duty
This is service that most of us have never been called upon to do.
We, each of us, have to live up to our end of the bargain.
We must fulfill our collective responsibility to each other.
Listening to public health rules is your duty.
Staying home is your way to serve.
So be smart about what you do, about the choices you make.
That is how you serve your country and how we will all serve each other.
How well we do this right now determines where our country will be in two weeks or in two months.
It’s in our hands.
It’s in your hands.
We all have a role to play.
We have a collective responsibility.
Where we find ourselves in a few weeks, in a few months, doesn’t depend on me: it depends on you.
I am calling on your civic conscience, to protect others.
If you do not follow the guidelines, you are putting others in danger.
We all have a moral obligation to stay home.
We all have a moral obligation to take care of one another.
We will get through this by working together.
By remaining true to our values, we will remain true to who we are as Canadians.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks updating Canadians on the rollout of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/04/01/prime-ministers-remarks-updating-canadians-rollout-canada-emergency
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-03-31,"Hello everyone.
The first thing I want to do this morning is to share an update about the Ukraine International Airlines tragedy that took so many innocent lives earlier this year.
Even as we face this new crisis, families and loved ones continue to grieve and seek answers.
I want to assure them and all Canadians that we have been working hard to get accountability and justice even as we fight this pandemic.
At the same time, we’ve also been developing a strategy with our other international partners to make sure such a tragedy never happens again.
Today, I’m appointing the Honourable Ralph Goodale as my special advisor for Canada’s ongoing response to the downing of Flight PS752.
With his decades of extraordinary service to Canada, including as Minister of Public Safety, Ralph has the right expertise to guide our response to this air disaster and provide recommendations for best practices going forward. He will also continue to push to see families properly compensated.
The second thing I want to do is share a story with you.
A few weeks ago, Dave Caputo, the owner of a start-up named Trusscore in the Waterloo region, called a meeting with his employees.
With mounting concerns around COVID-19, Dave asked his team how they could repurpose their building materials factory to make products hospitals needed.
A few days later, they had four prototypes drawn up.
They decided to make large panels, which hospitals could use to subdivide rooms and isolate people with COVID-19 from other patients.
Well on Monday, panels made of fully recycled materials were delivered at no cost to several hospitals in the region, including Grand River, St. Mary’s, and Guelph General Hospital.
Dave and his team showed what Canadians do in difficult times.
We don’t back down from a challenge.
We roll up our sleeves and we get to work.
I know that this pandemic has been incredibly challenging for people right across the country, but we are also seeing the best of what it means to be Canadian.
From coast to coast to coast, businesses are re-tooling to produce face shields, ventilators, hand sanitizers, and other supplies our health care professionals need.
To make it easier for companies to help out during this critical time, we launched Canada’s Plan to Mobilize Industry to fight COVID-19 a little over a week ago.
In the time since, we’ve spoken directly to almost 3,000 companies who’ve reached out to offer their help.
Before we go any further, I want to thank all the owners and entrepreneurs and managers who’ve answered our call to action.
This vital support comes at a critical time and the way you looked around and said not “How can I keep myself safe?” but “How can I keep myself and my employees safe and help out in this critical time?” is a real sign of leadership and a sign of what Canadians do best. In tough times, we pull together, we’re there for each other, we put up our hands and we ask: how can we help?
I also want, in the same vein, to thank everyone who is making, shipping, and delivering these products.
People who work in the manufacturing sector and in terms of getting people the items they need are on the front lines of this fight
Our country needs you through these tough times and we thank you deeply for everything you do.
By mobilizing industry, we can produce right here in Canada the items that our healthcare professionals need to protect themselves, treat patients who have COVID-19 and slow the spread of the virus.
When we announced our plan to mobilize industry, we said that we were close to reaching agreements with Thornhill Medical, Medicom, and Spartan Bioscience.
Today, we’re announcing that we have moved forward with contracts with these three Canadian companies to make medical supplies such as ventilators, surgical masks, and test kits.
I want to recognize the great work Minister Bains has done to make this happen.
We’ve also signed letters of intent with five other companies: Precision Biomonitoring, Fluid Energy Group, Irving Oil, Calko Group, and Stanfield’s.
We know that the demand for critical equipment and supplies will grow in the coming weeks, so we need a sustainable, stable supply of these products.
And that means making them at home and we’re optimistic that they will be available in the coming weeks.
So today, I’m also announcing that our existing Next Generation Manufacturing Supercluster will be leading companies in developing and scaling up new technologies to test and treat Canadians.
Demand for these goods is going up, so we’re making sure Canada is ready to keep up.
That’s why our government is also allocating $2 billion to purchase protective personal equipment, including for bulk purchases with provinces and territories.
This includes things like more masks and face shields, gowns, ventilators, test kits and swabs, and hand sanitizer.
Protective personal equipment is essential to protect our health care workers who are on the front lines of this fight.
We recognize that more is needed and everyone is working day and night to receive essential supplies.
We’re coordinating with the provinces and territories, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the experts to make sure our health care workers get everything they need.
This is a priority for our government and we will continue to source new solutions every day.
We are expecting shipments to come in in the coming days and we will continue to work tirelessly to get these supplies to where they’re needed.
Several businesses have also donated medical equipment and supplies to help fight COVID-19.
The Alibaba Group sent us 500,000 surgical masks and 100,000 screening tests to help us.
The COVID-19 Medical Support group—an agency that brings together healthcare professionals, engineers, entrepreneurs, and representatives from non-profit organizations—is working with several businesses to provide medical supplies.
To date, they have received commitments from Bombardier, 3M, and MedTronic to manufacture personal protective equipment.
And Toys “R” Us has committed to providing baby monitors to Canadian hospitals to ensure better communication between patients and healthcare professionals.
These monitors will also help to reduce unnecessary movement within the hospitals that could put lives in danger.
I want to thank the many businesses that have made donations for their generosity and leadership.
You are doing your part. And all Canadians should follow your example.
There’s no question we will need more masks, ventilators, and testing kits.
But how many more we need depends entirely on you.
If you stay home and follow public health recommendations, you can slow the spread.
And that means fewer patients in our hospitals, fewer people to test, and fewer ventilators to use on critical patients.
So, keep doing your part and help us keep Canada safe.
Thank you very much.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on health care supplies and equipment,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/03/31/prime-ministers-remarks-health-care-supplies-and-equipment
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-03-30,"Hello everyone.
Thank you for joining us.
To fight COVID-19, we are asking everyone to stay home as much as possible.
But these recommendations have meant a slowdown for businesses. Some have even had to close up shop.
This is worrying, not just for entrepreneurs and business owners, but also for your employees, who need their paycheque to make ends meet.
That’s why we launched a three-point plan to protect jobs, help those who have been laid off, and support businesses that are having cash-flow problems.
But we know that for a lot of people, their main priority is to keep getting paid.
So last week, we announced a wage subsidy to encourage employers to keep their employees.
To help employers keep people on the payroll, we announced that the government would subsidize up to 75 per cent of wages for qualifying businesses.
We know what businesses are going through.
Over the past few weeks, you’ve had to get creative to keep money coming in.
And in some cases, you’ve had to make the difficult decision of letting your employees go.
For people to get through this tough time and for the economy to rebound, people have to keep their jobs, so we announced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
I said last week that we would have more details to share and that’s the first thing I want to talk with you about today.
If your business’s revenues have decreased by at least 30 per cent because of COVID-19, you’ll be eligible for this subsidy.
The number of employees you have will not determine whether or not you get this support.
It will apply to non-profit organizations and charities, as well as companies both big and small.
This is about making sure that people are still getting paid whether they work for a business that employs 10 people or 1,000 people.
So, here’s what this means for workers: if you work for a company that has been impacted by COVID-19, the government will cover up to 75 per cent of your salary on the first $58,700 that you earn.
That means up to $847 a week.
And as I mentioned on Friday, this will be backdated to March 15.
This subsidy will make a real difference in your lives, and help everyone affected bridge to better times.
In Quebec, it’s going to help trucking and logistics company Energy Transportation Group to stay in business, so they can keep moving essential goods like food and toilet paper.
In Calgary, it will give a little breathing room to the Benj Hair Salon, which had to close shop to protect the health and safety of their clients.
Minister Morneau and Minister Ng are working hard to give companies the background documents explaining the technical details of this measure. And on that note, I want to thank the public service, who is working around the clock to get this done.
This subsidy is first and foremost about you – about hard-working employees across the country.
It’s about making sure you have money to buy groceries right now and a job to come back to later, once we’re through this.
Every business of every size is having to make some difficult decisions because of COVID-19 and that’s why the number of employees is not the eligibility criteria we’ve chosen.
This is in line with best practices we’ve observed in other countries.
That said, I want to offer a word of caution to businesses.
We are trusting you to do the right thing.
If you have the means to pay the remaining 25 per cent that’s not covered by the subsidy, please do so.
And if you think this is a system you can take advantage of or game, don’t.
There will be serious consequences for those who do.
This unprecedented situation calls for unprecedented action.
And it calls for good faith and trust between everyone involved.
We are in this together and that’s why our government is stepping up to help all employers keep their employees.
But for this to work, everyone has to do their part.
Every dollar of this should go to workers.
You should make every effort to top up their wages and every effort to hire back those workers who have been laid off in the past two weeks because of COVID-19.
That’s why we set up a comprehensive 3-point plan to support everyone across the economy weather the storm and come roaring back.
With the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, we’re protecting jobs.
With the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, we’re helping those who lose their job.
And with easy, guaranteed loans for businesses of all sizes, we’re helping people who need it access credit.
Additionally, to give you more time to pay your bills or more money for your daily expenses, we will defer GST and HST payments, as well as duties and taxes owed on imports, until June.
Since the beginning of this crisis, our top priority is to get you the help you need.
To do that, our government must be ready for every scenario.
Over the past few weeks, the Canadian Armed Forces have been gearing up to support our efforts and our communities as we fight COVID-19.
Our women and men in uniform have always been there for Canadians in their time of need and this pandemic is no exception.
For the moment, the federal government has not received any requests to intervene from the provinces or territories.
But if that changes, the Canadian Armed Forces will be ready to answer the call, as they have done throughout our history.
Whether to transport medical supplies or to protect our homes during flood and forest fire seasons, those who wear this uniform will be there for you.
They have a plan to support our communities during this difficult time.
At noon, several ministers and the Chief of the Defence Staff will hold a media availability to discuss this further.
We will also discuss emergency preparedness with the premiers during our next virtual meeting.
I want to take this opportunity to thank all the members of our armed forces for their hard work and their service.
You are always ready to help, and we greatly appreciate everything you do for us.
I know we’re all looking forward to the day when things are back to normal, but for that to happen, we all need to keep taking the right steps today.
It means following public health recommendations.
You know the drill.
Stay home as much as possible, wash your hands often, and keep at least 2 metres from each other.
And our government will keep doing everything we can to make sure workers are getting paid and companies are supported.
The measures we’ve announced will help do just that and ensure that our economy is well positioned to recover from this.
We’re going through a tough time right now, all together, but you know your government has your back.
And as always, if we need to do more, we will do more.
I want to close this morning by thanking all first responders across the country who are doing an incredible job for all Canadians. Medical professionals, first responders, custodial staff, farmers, people who work along the supply chain – thank you.
Going to work right now is stressful and I know you’re worried.
But we are doing everything we can to keep you safe.
You are doing essential work and we cannot thank you enough.
As always, Canada and Canadians will get through this by leaning on each other and everyone doing their part.
Thank you very much, my friends.
",Prime Minister’s remarks to workers and business owners facing challenges due to COVID-19,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/03/30/prime-ministers-remarks-workers-and-business-owners-facing-challenges-due
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-03-29,"Good morning, everyone.
The last month has been really challenging for a lot of people.
I hear that.
And our government is doing everything we can to help.
Over the last week alone, we’ve announced new support for families, for workers, and for businesses.
But even with this extra help, it’s hard out there right now.
Staying at home, for example, is not always easy.
For some, physical distancing means juggling taking care of the kids while trying to get some work done at the kitchen table.
But frankly, that’s not everyone’s reality.
For far too many people, home isn’t a safe place to be.
For others, it’s somewhere they’re isolated and alone.
And for too many more, they have no place to go at all.
Tough times fall first, and hardest, on the most vulnerable in our communities.
But we can change that.
We can make sure that no one is left without help.
Let me take a moment to speak directly to kids.
I know these past weeks have been tough.
You haven’t seen your friends, you’re not able to go to school, you’ve been hunkered down with your parents, and you’re watching the world you know change radically.
It’s a source of anxiety, it’s a source of tension.
Maybe there’s extra tension in your family, but there are people who can help.
Reach out to Kids Help Phone.
You can call them or text them. Text at 686868 or call 1-800-668-6868, or go online to KidsHelpPhone.ca.
They are there to listen, they are there to support you.
They are there to make sure you know you are not alone, and help you, and all of us, through this.
No matter where you live, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in French and in English.
Indeed, to make sure that you have the help you need, we’re investing $7.5 million for more counsellors and trained volunteers with Kids Help Phone.
There are people in your corner, making sure you’re OK.
And kids, I want to speak with your grandparents now.
Our seniors are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.
We all know that, and it’s for them that so many of us are staying home, are self-isolating, are following the rules.
But even if they’re safe and isolated, this is not easy on them.
Maybe they’re having trouble getting out to get groceries.
Maybe they’re feeling particularly lonely.
Maybe they’ve already been isolated and this is just an extra degree of stress on them.
Well, we’ve got help for them as well.
The Minister of Seniors, Deb Schulte, is announcing $9 million through the New Horizons for Seniors Program to United Way Canada, for everything from health check-ins to grocery delivery.
In fact, United Way Canada is already stepping-up—here in Ottawa, they’re helping people like you with things like meal delivery.
We promised to help everyone get through this tough time.
If you can’t go home because it isn’t safe, or because you don’t have a home—we’re not going to forget you.
We’ll work with the organizations you rely on and we’ll have your back.
Earlier this month, we committed $200 million for shelters.
If you need to get away from domestic violence, or violence because of your gender, if you need somewhere to stay, there are places you can go and be safe.
This new funding is already having a huge impact on support for you.
Just take the shelter in Toronto that can now rent additional space to isolate residents with COVID-19 and keep everyone safe.
And we’re going to keep working with charities and non-profits on this.
On that note, I want to recognize the incredible people who work and volunteer in their communities through these groups.
I know it’s been hard lately.
Not just because more and more people need your help.
But because you’re struggling to keep doing this work, for marginalized and vulnerable people, during a public health crisis on a scale Canada has never before seen.
Soon, I’ll have more to say about how we’ll make sure you’re supported, and can keep helping Canadians who need it most.
But the bottom line is this:
Whomever you are, whatever you need, we’re here for you.
And if you are fortunate enough to have a little extra to spare right now—I’m asking you to join in and be part of the solution.
Please, donate to your favourite organization, or find out how you can volunteer in your community.
Even working from home, you can make a real difference in the impact an organization can have.
As an individual, a family, a company, think of how you can lend a hand to help others through this tough time.
We all have a role to play in keeping people safe and healthy.
As we have often repeated, it’s very important for people to continue staying 2 metres apart, to stay home, and to avoid busy locations, so we can flatten the curve as quickly as possible.
I know that it’s even more difficult to stay at home on the weekend.
Sometimes, we can feel very lonely.
But don’t forget that we are all going through this together.
Just look around you, and you’ll see signs of solidarity.
Across the country and around the world, people are putting up rainbows to remind their neighbours that better days are ahead.
And if you’re in Montreal tonight, look to the Samuel De Champlain Bridge, which will be lit up with rainbow colours.
I know these are hard times.
But I also know that we’re going to get through them together.
Thank you everyone.
",Prime Minister’s remarks announcing additional support for vulnerable Canadians affected by COVID‑19,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/03/29/prime-ministers-remarks-announcing-additional-support-vulnerable-canadians
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-03-27,"Hello everyone. Happy Friday.
Let me just begin by saying I’m pleased with the supporting actions taken by the Bank of Canada this morning.
Monetary policy is very important, but as the Governor of the Bank has repeatedly said, the most important thing we can do to help people and the economy in this crisis is for the government to take strong fiscal action.
So, today, I want to speak directly to small business owners and entrepreneurs.
I know that for many of you, the past few weeks have been heartbreaking.
You’ve had to slow down your operations. In some cases, you’ve even had to close up shop for the foreseeable future.
And because money isn’t coming in, you can’t afford to keep your employees on the payroll.
These are really tough decisions.
Tough because you don’t want to let the people go who help you run your company in their time of need.
Tough because some of you have built your business over the course of many years, if not decades. And now, it seems like this climate of uncertainty could threaten everything you’ve worked for.
I know many Canadians across the country are saddened to see their favourite neighbourhood spots closed.
These are the places that make our communities feel like home.
Our government knows you’re really feeling the impacts of this pandemic, especially with the end of the month coming up.
So, here’s what we’re going to do to take some of that pressure off.
Last week, we had announced that we would cover 10 per cent of wages, but it’s becoming clear that we need to do more, much more, so we’re bringing that percentage up to 75 per cent for qualifying businesses.
This means that people will continue to be paid even though their employer has had to slow down or stop its operations because of COVID-19.
We’re helping companies keep people on the payroll, so that workers are supported and the economy is positioned to recover from this. That is our priority.
We will have more to say on this very soon, but I can tell you that this subsidy for small and medium-sized businesses will be backdated to Sunday, March 15.
For people who’ve lost their job or are self-employed, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will still be there to help you.
We also know that small, store-front businesses are struggling with cash flow right now. It’s hard to raise money and make money in this climate.
So, to help you bridge to better times, we are launching the Canada Emergency Business Account.
With this new measure, banks will soon offer $40,000 loans, which will be guaranteed by the government, to qualifying businesses.
The loan will be interest-free for the first year, and if you meet certain conditions, $10,000 of it will be forgivable.
Our government will also provide an additional $12.5 billion through Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank to help small and medium-sized businesses with their operational cash flow requirements.
This means that businesses will be able to apply for a guaranteed loan when they go to their financial institutions to get help as they weather the impacts of COVID-19.
Lastly, we’re announcing that we will defer GST and HST payments, as well as duties and taxes owed on imports, until June. This is the equivalent of giving $30 billion in interest-free loans to businesses.
So, if you’re struggling to get by right now and you have a payment due at the end of the quarter, we’re going to give you more time.
It will also allow you to keep money that would have been sent to the government and use it instead for your immediate needs.
With these new measures, our hope is that employers who are being pushed towards laying off people because of COVID-19 will think again.
And for those who have already had to lay off workers, we hope you will consider rehiring them given this payroll support.
Over the coming days, we will announce additional measures to help the most vulnerable.
Youth, marginalized people, people who live in poverty – we’re going to have more news to share with you very soon.
I know the past weeks have been really tough.
You’re worried about what COVID-19 means for your business and for your future.
These are uncertain times, but my message to you today is we’re going to be here for you.
Small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of our economy.
You are collectively the largest employer in the country.
You support millions of families. You serve our communities.
And you make our towns and cities better places to live.
Canadians are counting on you. I am counting on you to come back strong from this no matter what comes next.
You’re going to get the support you need to help rebuild a more resilient and prosperous economy.
So, to businesses across the country, please keep your workers on the payroll or think of hiring them back.
In the meantime, let’s keep listening to our public health officials.
Let’s wash our hands, stay home as much as possible, and keep a safe distance from each other when we go for a walk or when we have to go to the grocery store.
Together, I know we’re going to get through this.
Thank you very much, everyone.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-18,"Good morning, everyone.
I want to start today by confirming that Canada and the United States have agreed to extend by another 30 days the border measures that are currently in place.
This is an important decision, and one that will keep people on both sides of the border safe. It’s another example of the excellent collaboration between our two countries, and I want to thank Minister Bill Blair for leading the discussions with the United States.
We’re all here today, but it is the weekend.
And usually, a Saturday morning in April means getting outside to enjoy the sunshine, having a friend over for coffee, or just taking the kids to the park.
But these aren’t normal times.
We’re living through an unprecedented public health emergency, and we need to keep responding accordingly. So even as the weather gets nicer, and even in the weeks to come as we start seeing hopeful news—we can’t let up.
Because if we do, we could lose the progress that we’ve made.
Later today, you may see some new ads with people you know, like Hayley Wickenheiser, Chris Hadfield, Dr. Tam, Laurent Duvernay-Tardif, David Saint-Jacques and Dr. Mona Nemer, our Chief Science Advisor.
And they’ll remind you to “stay home and save lives.” That’s how we keep each other safe.
So stay at home. Limit your trips to the grocery store to less than once a week. If you do go out, keep two metres distance from each other. And as you do your part, know that we’re here to support you.
Over the past few weeks, we announced historic measures to help you get through this crisis.
With the Emergency Benefit, the Wage Subsidy and loans to small businesses, we support millions of families and workers across the country.
But we still have work to do. 
We still have people to help. So today, I am announcing further targeted support measures.
This morning, I am very happy to announce that the government will allocate more than $306 million to give Indigenous businesses the support they need.
This funding will be provided through Aboriginal Financial Institutions and administered by the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association. It will allow Indigenous businesses to access short-term, interest-free loans and non-repayable contributions so they are better positioned to make it through and rebound after this crisis.
Today’s investment will help thousands of businesses bridge to better times, including many that are owned and run by Indigenous women. These businesses employ people right across the country—in small communities and big cities alike.
So when we support them, we’re supporting families and workers, too. 
And this is just a first step—we’ll have more to say soon on what else we’ll do to help Indigenous businesses, and the people who rely on them. Small business owners are at the heart of so many communities.
And this is a tough time, whether you own a store, a restaurant, or are part of the hospitality sector.
So we’re going to be there for you.
With this new investment and with measures like the Canada Emergency Business Account, the wage subsidy, and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit—we’re focused on helping you. It will get easier.
But until it does, we need to be prepared to persevere.
And that includes ensuring that our frontline workers have the equipment and tools they need to do their jobs and stay safe.
Canada is continuing to receive shipments of personal protective equipment.
Yesterday, two planes full of N95 masks and coveralls arrived in Canada.
More shipments will be coming in this weekend and into next week, with additional medical supplies.
I can also announce that we will begin receiving deliveries of face shields from Toronto Stamp very soon.
They’ve shifted from their usual production of rubber stamps and ID badges, and will be providing millions of face shields over the next two months.
We all look forward to the time when this will be all over.
We all look forward to future Saturdays when we can see our friends or take our kids to a birthday party.
That day will come, but only if everyone keeps doing their part. So this weekend, stay home.
Continue to follow the experts’ guidelines.
And we will all get through this together.
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-17,"Hello everyone.
This morning, I want to start by updating you on the request for assistance we received from the Government of Quebec on Wednesday night and sharing the latest information on the supply of medical equipment.
The Minister of Public Safety has worked with Quebec and the Minister of National Defence, and I can now confirm that about 125 members of the Canadian Armed Forces with health training will go support workers in long-term care facilities.
We will continue working with the Government of Quebec to find other ways to support them, including with the Red Cross and the specialized volunteers who have registered with Health Canada.
In terms of medical equipment supplies, Bell Canada has donated 1.5 million N95 masks and we are working as quickly as possible to send them to our front-line workers.
This is in addition to the millions of surgical masks that we sent to the provinces and territories this week.
Over the past few weeks, the pandemic has created anxiety and uncertainty for all Canadians, but some are going through an especially tough time.
COVID-19 has brought many industries to a halt, and workers across the country are struggling as a result.
From the start, our goal as a government has been clear – to help all Canadians get through these challenging times.
As I’ve said many times before, we’re here to support you. To lend you a helping hand when you need it most.
Across the country, Canadians are standing shoulder to shoulder and we’re all in this together.
Today, our government is announcing more help for workers in Alberta, Saskatchewan, BC, and Newfoundland and Labrador.
We’re also announcing more help for small businesses. And more help for those who work in the arts, culture, and sports sectors.
I’ll start with the energy sector.
Right now, workers and families are struggling because of things beyond their control.
Both the devastating effects of the pandemic and the price war driven by foreign interests are a challenge.
As a result, companies have had to slow down or pause their operations, leaving too many people out of work.
To help these workers, our government will invest $1.7 billion to clean up orphan and inactive wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and BC.
These wells, which are no longer in use, can be detrimental not only to our environment, but to people’s health.
Think of the farmer who can’t grow anything on his land because of an abandoned well a few steps away from his home.
Think of the small town or Indigenous community struggling with this issue that has been festering for years or even decades.
Cleaning them up will bring people back to work and help many landowners who have had these wells on their property for years, but haven’t been able to get them taken care of and the land restored.
Our goal is to create immediate jobs in these provinces, while helping companies avoid bankruptcy, and supporting our environmental targets.
In Alberta alone, these investments will maintain 5,200 jobs. We developed this policy with the Government of Alberta and municipal partners, I want to thank them for their contributions.
We’ve listened to the concerns of landowners, municipalities, and Indigenous communities who want to make sure that the polluter pays principle is strengthened and that their voices are heard.
Our government will also establish a $750 million Emissions Reduction Fund, with a focus on methane, to create and maintain jobs through pollution reduction efforts.
This includes $75 million to help the offshore industry cut emissions in Newfoundland and Labrador.
This fund will primarily provide repayable contributions to firms to make them more competitive, reduce waste and pollution, and most importantly, protect jobs.
Right now, many energy firms are experiencing a cash crunch, so they don’t have the funds to invest in technologies to reduce emissions or fix methane leaks.
Today’s announcement will allow for this kind of work to be done and create jobs people need during this difficult time.
Through the wells and methane initiatives, we estimate that we will maintain roughly 10,000 jobs across the country.
Just because we’re in a health crisis, doesn’t mean we can neglect the environmental crisis.
We’re also working with BDC and EDC to expand credit support for at-risk medium-sized energy companies, so they can maintain operations and keep their employees.
Again, the goal is to allow these companies to continue operating in order to keep their employees.
Now, I want to turn to what we’re going to do next for small businesses and the people they employ.
Over the past few weeks, we’ve taken a number of steps to support these employers and mostly their employees.
We introduced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to help keep people on the payroll.
We launched and expanded the Canada Emergency Business Account for those businesses struggling with cash flow.
But Ministers Joly, Ng, Bains, and others have heard that some businesses are still falling through the cracks.
To fix that, our government will provide $962 million to regional development agencies and the Community Futures Network.
This money will provide the support needed by small businesses that are not eligible for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy or to get a loan under the Canada Emergency Business Account.
This funding will help ensure that more businesses – especially smaller employers based in more rural parts of the country or those who don’t have a relationship with a traditional financial institution – are getting the support that they need.
We’re also going to give $270 million to Futurpreneur Canada and the Industrial Research Assistance Program to support innovators and other early stage development firms that don’t qualify for the wage subsidy, but still need help. 
We also have an update for those who work in the arts, culture, and sports sectors.
Since the beginning of this crisis, artists have brought us comfort, laughter, and happiness.
Athletes have continued to inspire us, encourage us, and make us proud.
Those who work in the arts, culture, and sports sectors allow us to live their passion and make us dream.
And these days, when we are all at home, isolating, they help us feel a little less alone.
These are just a few of the reasons why we must be there for them, like they are there for us.
Our government will give $500 million to Heritage Canada to support those who work in the arts, culture, and sports sectors.
Like the small businesses I was talking about, people and businesses in these sectors do not have access to some of the help we’ve announced because of how the companies operate or how revenues are generated.
With this investment, people will be able to receive wage support and organizations that are struggling with cash flow will be able to access financing.
At the same time, we continue to support those who have lost their jobs with the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.
So far, over 7.5 million payments have been made. That’s money sent directly to those who need it most.
I want to again thank our amazing public servants who are processing these claims at record speeds.
Moving forward, we will be releasing the latest figures on the CERB through the government’s open data portal three times a week, so academics, researchers, and Canadians can keep track of the work being done.
We will continue to provide and open up data, so that we can get the best advice from experts and continue to help Canadians.
It protects the right of each and every one of us to be who we are.
To worship how we want, to love whom we love.
At the heart of the Charter is the notion of choice. That we can choose the kind of life we want for ourselves.
As our country confronts this pandemic, I am especially grateful that Canadians have chosen to protect each other and care for one another.
To everyone who has stayed home and followed public health recommendations – thank you.
Making that choice together today will ensure that we remain who we are as Canadians for generations to come.
Thank you very much, everyone.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-16,"Hello everyone.
Just this morning, I had a call with the other G7 leaders to discuss the pandemic. We all remain committed to doing whatever it takes to help people and our economies rebound after this crisis.
We’re working together to support international efforts to develop a vaccine, expand treatment, expand testing, and ensure that critical medical supplies get to the front-lines.
As I’ve said before, this is a global crisis and it demands a global response.
While we’re doing everything to keep people safe in our respective countries, we also have to help more vulnerable nations fight this virus by providing more support for their health care systems, debt relief, and other forms of assistance.
We will keep working together as partners to ensure the safety and health of people around the world.
Over the past few weeks, our government has launched a series of measures to help people get through difficult situations caused by this pandemic.
With the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, we are helping people to continue receiving a salary, even if the company they work for has had to slow down or stop operating completely.
With the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, we’re giving $2,000 a month to those who are no longer able to earn a living because of the virus.
And yesterday, we announced that we would be expanding the eligibility criteria to allow more people to get the help they need.
If you are a seasonal worker, if you earn less than $1,000 a month, or if you have recently exhausted your employment insurance benefits, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be there for you.
At the same time, we are working with the provinces and territories to increase the salaries of essential workers who earn less than $2,500 a month.
Auxiliary nurses, senior care providers, all those who are working hard to maintain some semblance of normalcy are doing an extraordinary job, even as conditions become increasingly difficult.
They deserve not only our thanks, but also our support.
This evening, I will be discussing this with my provincial and territorial colleagues during our weekly meeting.
We will also be discussing how we can better protect the elderly living in seniors’ residences and long-term care facilities.
Last night, the Minister of Public Safety, Bill Blair, received an official request for assistance from the Government of Quebec to help health care workers.
We are working closely with Quebec to finalize an assistance plan and we will have more information for you soon.
But I can tell you that we will be giving the province all the help we can, looking to the Canadian Red Cross, the Canadian Armed Forces, and specialized volunteers who have registered with Health Canada.
We will always be there for Canadians who are in need of help.
Another issue that often comes up during the meeting with the premiers is the supply of medical equipment.
This morning I can confirm that the government has finalized contracts with several Canadian companies, including Geometric Energy Corporation in Calgary, which will provide millions of gloves to our health care workers.
Later today, Minister Anand will provide an update on the latest supply developments.
Over the past few weeks, we’ve rolled out a series of measures to get people the help they need as quickly as possible.
As things evolve, we’re hearing from Canadians who need more help. From businesses who need more support.
No one should feel as if they’re alone in this fight.
Our government is here to help you through these challenging times.
So, when we hear the program is not reaching as many people as it should, we make changes.
A few weeks ago, we launched the Canada Emergency Business Account to help small businesses struggling with cash flow.
Under this program, banks are offering $40,000 loans, which are guaranteed by the government.
To date, more than 195,000 loans have been approved. We’re talking about more than $7.5 billion in credit to small- and medium-sized businesses.
It’s a start, but Minister Ng and others have heard from business owners who could really use this help, but who do not fit the current admissibility criteria, so we’re going to make some adjustments because we want to be there to support you.
Today, we are expanding the Canada Emergency Business Account by both increasing and decreasing the eligibility threshold.
Now, businesses who spent between $20,000 and $1,500,000 in total payroll in 2019 will be eligible to receive a loan through the CEBA.
That’s businesses who spent between $20,000 and $1,500,000 in total payroll in 2019 who will now be eligible.
This is money entrepreneurs and employers can use to cover operational costs and help with other immediate needs.
Businesses and commercial property owners are also facing specific challenges because of COVID-19, so we plan on introducing the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance.
This program will provide support to help small businesses with their rent for the months of April, May, and June.
To implement this program, we have to work with the provinces and territories as they govern rental relationships and we hope to have more details to share very soon.
Over the past few weeks, we’ve all had to get used to this new normal.
It’s been snowing in some places this week, including here in Ottawa, because that’s just what 2020 brings.
But we hope that the weather will get nicer.
As time goes on, staying home and not seeing friends is going to be even more difficult.
We’re going to miss our colleagues, our friends, our neighbours, and our parents even more than we do now. 
But we have to be disciplined. We must stay the course.
We cannot let the progress we’ve made go to waste.
And above all, we cannot put lives at risk.
So, let’s keep following public health recommendations.
Wash your hands. Stay home as much as possible.
And if you do go out, be sure to stay at least two metres away from others.
If we persist and persevere, I know that we will prevail.
Once again, thank you all for joining us.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on additional support for small businesses during COVID‑19,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/04/16/prime-ministers-remarks-additional-support-small-businesses-during-covid
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-15,"Hello, everyone.
Before I get started, I want to take a moment to recognize Canadians who are doing some of the toughest jobs in the country.
The women and men working in our hospitals, our seniors’ homes, and our long-term care facilities are making sacrifices every day.
If you do one of these jobs – thank you. Thank you for keeping us safe and healthy, and protecting our loved ones.
You deserve our full support.
So if you need a hand getting through these tough times, we’ll be there for you.
Today, we’re announcing more help for more Canadians.
This includes topping up the pay of essential workers.
At the same time, we’ll also be expanding the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to reach people who are earning some income, as well as for seasonal workers who are facing no jobs and for those who have run out of their EI regular benefits recently.
And a little later, I’ll have some news about where we are with testing.
You heard me speak in Parliament about the contributions of the Greatest Generation, who grew up during the Great Depression and fought through the Second World War.
Today, across the country, the last members of this generation live in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
The uncomfortable and tragic truth is that the very places that care for our elderly are the most vulnerable to COVID-19.
I will be addressing this with premiers tomorrow night. 
We all need to do better, we all need to take leadership, for the seniors who have built this country.  
Our government will work with the provinces and territories to boost wages for essential workers who are making under $2,500 a month, like those in our long-term care facilities.
For many workers looking after the most vulnerable Canadians, including seniors and those with disabilities, we know conditions have gotten more difficult over the past weeks.
And you need support right now.
Tomorrow, in our weekly meeting, I will discuss with provincial and territorial leaders the importance of getting this wage boost in place as quickly as possible.
As we face an unprecedented threat to public health, you are our most important line of defence.
We will do whatever we can to help you do your job and support you through this time.
In March, our government launched the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.
This measure is part of a plan we implemented to ensure that everyone has the help they need to get through this difficult time.
Millions of people have already received the benefit, but we know that a lot of people are not eligible and still need help.
Today, I can announce that we are expanding the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to include people making up to $1,000 a month, seasonal workers, and people whose EI regular benefits have recently run out.  
Maybe you’re a volunteer firefighter, or a contractor who can pick up some shifts, or you have a part-time job in a grocery store.
Even if you’re still working, or if you want to start working again, you probably need help in making ends meet.
So if you earn $1,000 or less a month, you’ll now be able to apply for the CERB.
If you were expecting a seasonal job that isn’t coming because of COVID-19, you’ll now be able to apply.
And if you’ve run out of EI regular benefits recently, you can now apply for the CERB as well.
This context is also difficult for artists and creators across the country.
Cultural spaces are closed and work is becoming scarce.
Minister Guilbeault heard from artists asking that copyrights from work done before the crisis not be included to access the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, and that is what we’re going to do.
So, in these anxious times, artists are continuing to help us think, to help us dream, and to shine a little light into our daily lives; and for this we are always grateful.
And for others who still need help—including postsecondary students, and businesses worried about commercial rent—we’ll have more to say to you very soon.
After having accepted the first demand for help from the Canadian Armed Forces for Nunavik, the Government of Québec sent us a second request for Basse-Côte-Nord.
I can confirm that the Canadian Rangers will be there to provide support. 
I want to thank our women and men in uniform, and the families who serve alongside them, for all that they do.
Whenever we need you most, you’re always there for us.
At times, we may feel overwhelmed by what is going on.
We are in a situation that may seem unreal and it’s not always easy to deal with everything that’s happening around us.
This week, the government launched a portal with all of the mental health resources that are available to you.
Please visit canada.ca or use the Canada COVID-19 app to talk to someone.
There is nothing wrong with feeling this way.
The important thing is that you reach out. 
Finally, we have more news today to share on testing.
LuminUltra from New Brunswick, with whom we signed a contract, is now ramping up production to supply enough COVID-19 test chemicals to meet the weekly demand in all provinces.
And in the last few days, we received a new batch of swabs to make sure every province has the supplies they need to keep testing.
Whether it’s reagents or test kits, we are ensuring that Canada has the tools to fight this virus.
Tomorrow, I’ll also be speaking with the other G7 leaders about continuing to coordinate a strong and effective global response to this pandemic.
I know that everyone wants to know when life will be getting back to normal.
And the reality is, we can’t give you a specific date.
But this is what we do know:
For this to end, you have to stay home.
We have to limit how often we go out and stay two metres away from others.
And if everyone does their part, we will get through this together. 
Thank you.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-14,"Hello, everyone.
Today, just like every day, nurses and doctors, lab techs and hospital staff, are hard at work to keep us safe.
They’re showing up for us, and we need to do the same for them.
Over the weekend, we received new shipments of essential personal protective equipment, including four planes worth of N95 masks.
There was also an order for Quebec.
As we speak, workers are unpacking and validating these supplies so we can start shipping them to the provinces and territories as quickly as possible.
These new N95 masks are in addition to the more than 820,000 that went to provinces last week.
All told, this means that we have 1.1 million N95s ready to be shipped to the provinces and territories, with more to come.
We have also received millions of pairs of gloves, and we’ll be getting new protective gowns delivered from domestic suppliers starting next Monday.
In the last few days, we’ve also made progress on testing.
Right now, we’re moving forward on a range of rapid testing kits, both from here in Canada and internationally.
This includes Ottawa-based Spartan Bioscience, who will soon be supplying tens of thousands of kits per month, and potentially more as production increases.
As Dr. Tam said yesterday, more than 430,000 tests have been done in Canada.
Our experts and health professionals are studying new technologies and are working hard to increase our capacity to keep ramping up tests across the country.
Demand for these supplies is going up.
And we’re going to make sure Canada can keep up.
COVID-19 has changed the daily lives of all Canadians, but those who live in the Arctic regions are clearly not having the same issues as those who live in cities.
For example, I know that a lot of people are worried about seeing empty grocery shelves.
I want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to prevent that from happening.
Today, I can announce that we’re are investing almost $130 million to support Northern communities in dealing with COVID-19.
If you live in the North, chances are you’re worried about whether your local health centre has the resources to fight COVID-19 and to cope with cases that might come up.
So we’re providing $72.6 million to the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut specifically for health care and community preparedness.
We’re also investing more money in Nutrition North Canada.
This will make it easier to afford the food and basics that keep you and your family healthy.
And to ensure that things like groceries and medical equipment can continue to get to you, we are providing funding for northern air carriers to transport these supplies.
These are tough times, but we’re going to help you through them. To set your community up to come back strong when things get better – because they will – we have to think about small businesses, too.
I know entrepreneurs in the North have been hit especially hard by this crisis.
If you own a business and your costs aren’t already covered by other measures we’ve put in place, we’re giving CanNor more funding to help.
No matter where you live, in a small community or a big city, we’re here for you.
This weekend, we brought Parliament back to pass the largest economic policy since the Second World War.
With the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, we will protect jobs by helping businesses keep their employees on the payroll.
We’ll be rolling this measure out as quickly as possible.
And now, as many people as we’ve already helped – and we’re talking about millions of Canadians – we know there is more to do.
You might not currently qualify for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, but you still might need a hand.
If you’re a student or an essential worker, for example, this week we’ll be talking at how to reach you, while also supporting sectors that have been especially hard hit.
At the same time, we’re working to enhance the Canada Emergency Business Account, as well as new supports on commercial rent for businesses that are hardest hit.
I’ll have more to say about all this soon.
If you’ve come back to Canada from abroad, as of today we are strengthening measures.
Now, if asymptomatic travellers cannot explain a credible quarantine plan, they will be required to quarantine in a hotel.
This will come into effect at midnight tonight.
We’re also announcing $20 million for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to strengthen food inspections and keep our food supply safe.
This will mean we can build capacity for more over-time and extra shifts for inspectors to fill demand.
It also means we can invest in things like hiring and training, to get more people on board.
We are going through a difficult time.
And across the country, I know that a lot of people are worried, not just about their future or their own health, but about their parents’ and their grandparents’ health.
Seniors are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, which means that we should not go visit them in seniors’ residences or in long-term care facilities.
To help protect them, we have published new guidelines for these types of establishments.
We have established clear rules on restricting visits, staff controls, and the procedures to follow in case of infection.
At the same time, we are continuing to work with the provinces and territories to ensure they have everything they need to keep people healthy.
I want to take a moment to speak directly to everyone who’s lost a loved one.
If you’re grieving, know that you’re not alone.
We are here for you, even through this incredibly tough time.
And you remind us why it’s so important to do everything we can to keep one another safe.
We all need to do our part, we can’t let up now.
So to everyone – stay at home.
And no matter what, stay 2 metres apart if you do have to go out.
When it gets hard, let’s remember that we’re all in this together.
Thank you very much.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-11,"Mr. Speaker,
I rise here, in this moment, in this House, as our generation faces its greatest challenge yet.
We all stand on the shoulders of those who came before us.
Of all those Canadians who saw our nation through difficult, tumultuous times in our history.
103 years ago today, young Canadian soldiers were in the trenches of France, thousands of kilometres from home.  
The next day, they would storm Hill 145, doing their part to win the Battle of Vimy Ridge.
Today, on this sombre anniversary, we remember their courage and sacrifice.
We remember these soldiers who shaped the country we know today.
20 years later, many would be sent to the front again.
On the evening of November 14, 1940, my grandfather, the young MP for Vancouver North, rose in his seat to speak to the war effort, but first thanked all those senior members who allowed him to speak before them, because his leave from the RCAF had expired that night, and he was to ship out soon.
Jimmy Sinclair would spend the next three and a half years in Europe and North Africa, far from his young family, far from his work in this House of Commons, far from his constituents in British Columbia, serving his country in the best way he knew how.
He would return to the chamber in early 1944, a mere few months before D-Day, to exhort Canadians to continue with the sacrifices and efforts required to win.
“This is the year which will decide a rapid victory or a long and protracted war; a year when our fighting men must be given every conceivable aid and support and encouragement by every man, woman, and child in Canada, no matter the personal cost.”
These were trials that shaped our country, and more, our citizens.
And now, once again, we are being tried.
But Mr. Speaker – this is not a war.
That doesn’t make this fight any less destructive, any less dangerous.
But there is no front line marked with barbed wire. No soldiers to be deployed across the ocean. No enemy combatants to defeat.
Instead, the front line is everywhere.
In our homes. In our hospitals and care centres. In our grocery stores and pharmacies. At our truck stops and gas stations.
And the people who work in these places are our modern-day heroes.
Separated from their family, risking their own health – they head to work every day so that we can eat.
So that we can heal.
So that we can do our part.
Because every one of us has a role to play in helping shield our country from the threat it now faces.
In hard times, courage and strength are not defined by what we say or do loudly, in public, but by the actions we take quietly, in private.
Like staying home.
Even as we stand apart, we stand united in our resolve to do what we must until COVID-19 is defeated.
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to pass the Emergency Wage Subsidy.
This is the most important Canadian economic policy since the Second World War.
This subsidy will allow Canadians to keep their jobs and paycheques during this crisis.
This is what we are voting on this afternoon.   
This subsidy builds on measures already taken to help Canadians, like guaranteed loans for small businesses and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for those who have lost their jobs.
Once again, in this House, we are being called upon to support those in need and I know we won’t let them down.
Mr. Speaker – As Canada confronts this crisis, we are all called to serve.
To fight for and alongside each of our fellow citizens.
To fight for someone’s mother. For someone’s grandfather. For someone’s neighbour.
Our job as Canadians is to uphold the dignity and sanctity of every single human life – whether they be rich or poor, young or old, ailing or healthy.
That is our duty.
Without reservation, without pause, we must fight for every inch of ground against this disease.
We must be there for one another as we spare no effort to safeguard our collective future.
In the coming weeks and months, we will face many obstacles.
We will go through more moments of uncertainty.
Fear and anxiety will continue to be part of daily life for most of us.
And, sadly, we will grieve together for the loss of our loved ones.
